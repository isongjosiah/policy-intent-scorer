Under my leadership, the United States military will remain the mightiest, fiercest, boldest, and most revered in the entire world. Our service members will always be prepared to defend American interests and American security in the Indo-Pacific and elsewhere, standing ready to summon the same bold fighting spirit that America’s heroes did at Guadalcanal and throughout the Pacific theater during World War II.\nThe gallant troops at Guadalcanal fought not for territorial conquest, but to conquer tyranny and defend our way of life.  In their honor, we pay tribute to the enduring legacy of our Nation’s sons who selflessly took up arms to secure an obscure yet pivotal island in the Pacific in defense of our freedom, our home, and our beloved civilization.",

Trump signed an Executive Order restoring two iconic pillars of American youth: the Presidential Fitness Test and the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition. This historic action underscores the Administration’s commitment to ending the childhood chronic disease epidemic and ensuring the strength, vitality, and excellence of future generations of Americans.\nPresident Trump was joined by Vice President JD Vance, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., as well as legendary American athletes including golfing greats Bryson DeChambeau and Annika Sörenstam, National Football Association icon Lawrence Taylor, Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, and wrestler Triple H.\nWith this Executive Order, President Trump is bringing back a time-honored tradition that inspired millions of American children to strive for their best—physically, mentally, and civically. The Presidential Fitness Test, which will be administered by Secretary Kennedy, reestablishes a gold standard for youth physical fitness across the United States.\n“We are building a nation of strong, proud, and unstoppable young Americans. The Presidential Fitness Test is not just about physical strength—it’s about character, competition, and confidence,” President Trump said. “Together, we are making fitness fun, competitive, and cool again.”\nThe revitalized President’s Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition will create school-based programs that reward excellence in physical education and support the development of a Presidential Fitness Award. By working in close partnership with athletes, coaches, sports teams, and schools nationwide, the Council will champion access to fitness and healthy living for all Americans.\nPresident Trump also announced that the Council will play an important role in helping to restore tradition to college sports, including reforming the broken transfer portal and keeping men out of women’s sports.\nThe Trump Administration is laying the groundwork for an American sports renaissance. Thanks to the efforts of President Trump, the United States in the next three years will host the Ryder Cup, the President’s Cup, the FIFA World Cup, and the Olympic Games. The year 2026 will also mark the 250th anniversary of the America’s founding and the 70th anniversary of the original President’s Council on Youth Fitness.\n“This is a movement about discipline, strength, and excellence,” said President Trump. “The more we empower our kids to push harder, reach higher, and strive together, the more we secure America’s greatness for generations to come.”\nFor more information about the Executive Order and the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition, visit whitehouse.gov.",

President Donald J. Trump has expressed his commitment to solving this problem on behalf of future Administrations and the American people. The White House is one of the most beautiful and historic buildings in the world, yet the White House is currently unable to host major functions honoring world leaders and other countries without having to install a large and unsightly tent approximately 100 yards away from the main building entrance. The White House State Ballroom will be a much-needed and exquisite addition of approximately 90,000 total square feet of ornately designed and carefully crafted space, with a seated capacity of 650 people — a significant increase from the 200-person seated capacity in the East Room of the White House. In recent weeks, President Trump has held several meetings with members of the White House Staff, the National Park Service, the White House Military Office, and the United States Secret Service to discuss design features and planning.  President Trump has chosen McCrery Architects as lead architect, which is well-known for their classical architectural design and based in our nation’s capital. CEO Jim McCrery said: “Presidents in the modern era have faced challenges hosting major events at the White House because it has been untouched since President Harry Truman. I am honored that President Trump has entrusted me to help bring this beautiful and necessary renovation to The People’s House, while preserving the elegance of its classical design and historical importance.” The construction team will be headed by Clark Construction, and the engineering team will be led by AECOM.  The project will begin in September 2025, and it is expected to be completed long before the end of President Trump’s term.  President Trump, and other patriot donors, have generously committed to donating the funds necessary to build this approximately $200 million dollar structure. The United States Secret Service will provide the necessary security enhancements and modifications.  The White House Ballroom will be substantially separated from the main building of the White House, but at the same time, it’s theme and architectural heritage will be almost identical. The site of the new ballroom will be where the small, heavily changed, and reconstructed East Wing currently sits. The East Wing was constructed in 1902 and has been renovated and changed many times, with a second story added in 1942.  The White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said the following: “President Trump is a builder at heart and has an extraordinary eye for detail. The President and the Trump White House are fully committed to working with the appropriate organizations to preserving the special history of the White House while building a beautiful ballroom that can be enjoyed by future Administrations and generations of Americans to come.”  The White House will continue to provide the American public with updates on this project at whitehouse.gov/visit.",

They enshrined a divine truth that changed the world forever when they declared, “all men are created equal.”\nAs we honor 249 glorious years of American independence, we celebrate these rights upon which our nation was built—and we pay tribute to the titans of freedom who risked their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to secure our sovereignty.\nIn June 1776, Thomas Jefferson began drafting what would later become one of the core foundational documents of the United States.  After 17 days of writing and several days of deliberations, revisions, and scrutiny over every line and every phrase, on July 4, 1776, Jefferson and his fellow signatories formally adopted the Declaration of Independence.\nThough the consequences of their actions were far from certain, the Second Continental Congress pressed forward with fierce determination, clarity of purpose, and an unshakable faith in God’s divine providence.  Our Founding Fathers boldly proclaimed “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”\nTo this day, these words give life to our Republic, stir the hearts of every citizen, and animate our way of life.  The Declaration of Independence was not just a statement of political protest but a revolution in moral and political thought.  For nearly two-and-a-half centuries, there has been no greater barrier to tyranny and oppression than these mighty words, rooted in “the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God.”\nAs we approach 250 years of independence, one year from today, my Administration continues to work tirelessly to revive our sovereignty, restore our strength, and reclaim the sacred ideals articulated in the Declaration of Independence.  Today, we summon the courage of every legend of liberty who bravely signed his name to the Declaration of Independence 249 years ago—and we invoke the spirit of 1776 to propel our Nation into a new era of restoration, renewal, confidence, and strength.",

Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia launched an invasion of the North with a set of clear goals: push the fighting from war-torn Virginia past the Mason-Dixon line, defeat the Union troops on their own soil, and force President Abraham Lincoln into peace negotiations.\nWith the very fate of the Republic at stake, the Union forces remained steadfast in their resolve to defend the freedom of their fellow countrymen as their last full measure of devotion.  The Union Army of the Potomac—led first by General Joseph Hooker and then by General George Meade—marched north to pursue the Confederate forces.  Divisions of the two forces met near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on July 1, 1863.\nWhat began as an unplanned encounter quickly erupted into an epochal struggle with the entire war and the very fate of our Nation at stake.  As Union defensive lines, known as the famed “fishhook,” came under attack by Confederate forces from three directions, brother met brother amid fierce clashes in places whose names have been indelibly marked in the chapters of American history: Little Round Top, Devil’s Den, and the Peach Orchard, to name but a few.  With the failure of Pickett’s Charge on Cemetery Ridge on July 3, the battle was won, the high-water mark of the Confederacy had been reached, and the course of the remaining years of the Civil War was set.  The Confederacy would never recover from their loss at Gettysburg—paving the way to the ultimate surrender of Lee’s Army at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865, and the end of the Confederacy itself.\nFrom July 1-3, 1863, of the estimated 51,000 casualties on both side, 7,058 souls were lost—3,155 Union and 3,903 Confederate were, making the Battle of Gettysburg the bloodiest battle to ever take place on American soil.  Just months later, in November of 1863, President Lincoln would stand on these hallowed grounds and immortalize these heroic sacrifices in his historic Gettysburg Address, proclaiming that “we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”\nThese words continue to inspire citizens all across our land.  In the darkest days of our Nation’s history, thousands of courageous men left behind their homes and families for the noble causes of duty, honor, and country.  On the anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, we pay tribute to the patriots who valiantly shed their blood to cast out slavery and preserve our glorious Union.  Their unwavering courage, selfless sacrifice, and unfailing devotion to our founding principles define the eternal triumph of the American spirit.",

The legacy of that sacrifice includes our alliance with Japan—forged after that terrible conflict—that embodies our shared commitment to freedom and openness, which is a beacon for the world. In southern Okinawa, the Cornerstone of Peace monument rests on the site where the fighting ended, serving as a somber reminder that the shared tragedy of war and loss of life touches every generation.  Every American soul inscribed on that black granite wall will be forever remembered as an immortal champion of valor, liberty, and sacrifice.\nOn this 80th anniversary of the Battle of Okinawa, our Nation pays tribute to the fearless young warriors who endured unimaginable devastation—and we honor those who valiantly laid down their lives for the sacred causes of freedom, sovereignty, and human dignity.",

Res. 87, “Joint Resolution providing congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to ‘California State Motor Vehicle and Engine Pollution Control Standards; Heavy-Duty Vehicle and Engine Emission Warranty and Maintenance Provisions; Advanced Clean Trucks; Zero Emission Airport Shuttle; Zero-Emission Power Train Certification; Waiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision’”; (2) H.J. Res. 88, “Joint Resolution providing congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to ‘California State Motor Vehicle and Engine Pollution Control Standards; Advanced Clean Cars II; Waiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision’”; and (3) H.J. Res. 89, “Joint Resolution providing congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to ‘California State Motor Vehicle and Engine and Nonroad Engine Pollution Control Standards; The ‘Omnibus’ Low NOX Regulation; Waiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision’”.\nThese bipartisan measures prevent California’s attempt to impose a nationwide electric vehicle mandate and to regulate national fuel economy by regulating carbon emissions.  Because of the joint resolutions I signed today, California’s Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Omnibus Low NOX programs are fully and expressly preempted by the Clean Air Act and cannot be implemented.\nPreemption of these programs is essential to preserving the Constitution’s allocation of power both among the States and between the States and the Federal Government.  It is the Federal Government, not States, that should establish vehicle emissions standards given the inherently interstate nature of air quality; a patchwork of State vehicle regulations on this subject is unworkable.  Our Constitution does not allow one State special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire Nation.\nAs the Congress’s joint resolutions make clear, California’s attempts to impose an electric vehicle mandate, regulate national fuel economy, and regulate greenhouse gas emissions are not eligible for waivers of preemption under section 209 of the Clean Air Act.  This provision of the Clean Air Act authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to grant waivers to California to address only compelling and extraordinary localized issues.  It can never again be misused to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which inherently do not have localized effects, much less compelling and extraordinary local effects, or vehicle emissions across the Nation.\nUnder the Congressional Review Act, the EPA cannot approve any future waivers that are “substantially the same” as those disapproved in the joint resolutions.  The core of the waivers at issue are their authorization of California to regulate greenhouse gas and NOX emissions from internal combustion engines and to impose what amounts to an electric vehicle mandate across the Nation.  Accordingly, the joint resolutions prohibit the EPA from approving future waivers for California that would impose California’s policy goals across the entire country and violate fundamental constitutional principles of federalism, ending the electric vehicle mandate for good.\n                              DONALD J.

We commemorate the fulfillment of Jesus Christ’s earthly mission and the birth of His holy and living Church. On Pentecost, 50 days after Jesus Christ’s resurrection from the dead on Easter Sunday, the Holy Spirit descended upon His Apostles in the form of a mighty wind—empowering them to speak in tongues and proclaim the good news of the Gospel to lands and peoples near and far.  “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit,” the Apostle Peter boldly declared. Equipped with the courage, clarity, and grace of Almighty God, in the years that followed, the Apostles went on to withstand tremendous danger to bring hearts, minds, and souls to the Christian faith—marking the beginning of the Church, against which even the evils of hell shall not prevail.  More than 2,000 years later, the Holy Spirit continues to descend upon all those who proclaim Christ’s name—enabling them to spread The Gospel. As we celebrate this glorious feast day, we also honor all Christians who, like the Apostles, have willingly endured persecution because of their faith.  My Administration will always defend the right of every American to worship God freely and without fear.  For this reason, I created the White House Faith Office and proudly instituted the White House Religious Liberty Commission to safeguard and promote America’s founding principle of religious freedom.  Under my leadership, we are protecting God in the public square and emboldening every believer to live their faith freely, openly, and without threat of persecution. As we celebrate the miracle of Pentecost and birth of Christ’s Church, we pray that the Holy Spirit fills our Nation and her people with abundant grace—bringing us peace, protection, and God’s presence. May God bless you, and may He continue to bless the United States of America.  Have a blessed Pentecost!",

Roosevelt knew our Armed Forces had to act decisively.  He tasked Admiral Chester Nimitz, a submariner and newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, with launching a full-scale effort to restore the Navy’s remaining ships to fighting condition.  With vital intelligence from American codebreakers, the Allies stayed one step ahead, anticipating the major elements of Japan’s strategy.\nAt dawn on June 4, 1942, the U.S. Navy struck back.  Despite facing a larger enemy force and suffering heavy losses, the U.S. fleet under the command of Admirals Jack Fletcher and Raymond Spruance fought with unmatched resolve.  In the course of twenty-four hours, they sank four Japanese aircraft carriers, destroyed a heavy cruiser, and crushed Japanese hopes of advancing deeper into the eastern Pacific—paving the way for our Nation’s acceptance of Japan’s unconditional surrender and the end of World War II in 1945.\nToday, former enemies stand united as allies.  The United States and Japan have forged an enduring partnership built on the shared values of freedom, sovereignty, and an abiding commitment to peace across the Indo-Pacific.  Together, we are advancing the causes of safety, security, prosperity, and liberty—all while confronting threats from China and North Korea.\nThe epic Battle of Midway stands to this day as a glorious reminder that, even in the face of long odds, perilous danger, and tremendous uncertainty, no challenge is too great for the strength of the American spirit.  As our Nation commemorates this legendary battle, we honor the grit of our servicemen, we pay tribute to the sacrifice of our veterans, and we vow to carry forward the legacy of the fallen heroes who secured victory over tyranny in the Pacific 80 years ago.",

Nothing against fathers, of course, but in my opinion, and I am sure everyone in this room agrees—only a mother can grasp this particular point.\nMilitary Mothers and America, together, have developed an extraordinary, parallel journey. They are filled with stories of personal sacrifice, determination, loss, and healing. Certainly, only military mothers have experienced this level of grace and resilience, of American life.\nAnd finally, aging—a sudden shift in family dynamics, an unexpected positioning change in life when caretakers become the caregivers. If this has happened within your family, you understand the precious nature of motherhood.\nHere now, in the White House, at this pivotal moment, I urge you to prioritize your well-being. Nurture yourself, for your strength is the bedrock of a brighter future for our children. By caring for ourselves, we empower the next generation to thrive. Together, let’s build a legacy of resilience and hope. Your journey matters. Embrace it!\nAnd indeed, the sacred strength of women is a profound force. With unwavering love and nurturing wisdom, we have the ability to inspire, uplift, and shape the future hearts of our children. This power, rooted in compassion and resilience, is a beacon of hope that lights the way for generations to come.\nLet us unite to honor the beauty of motherhood, champion the grace of our journey, and inspire those who follow.\nA mother’s love and wisdom empower our children to flourish, instilling in them the courage to reach their fullest potential.\nMotherhood.

These efforts include the bipartisan passage of the “Take It Down Act,” signed into law on Monday, May 19, 2025, and a $25 million investment secured in the President’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget to support youth transitioning out of foster care. \nThe full remarks of First Lady Melania Trump from the 2025 Senate Spouses Luncheon are provided below.\nFull Remarks by First Lady Melania Trump at the Senate Spouses Luncheon, National Gallery of Art – May 21, 2025\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you, Jonathan, Julie, Sandy, and Margaret, for your kind introductions and for the warm welcome I’ve received today. I’m grateful to all of you for your contributions to Fostering the Future, a cornerstone of the BE BEST initiative.\nMany thanks to Kaywin with the National Gallery of Art and to Usha for her service to our Nation.\nAs we gather here today, we stand not only as partners of elected officials but as influential advocates capable of inspiring change and advancing vital issues. Let us harness our collective power to uplift others and remain dedicated to shaping a brighter future for the next generation, who will lead us forward.\nAt the core of our gathering is the understanding that empathy and public service are not merely ideals; they are fundamental actions. They manifest in bipartisan laws that protect children from exploitation. They are evident in budgetary choices that prioritize the needs of vulnerable young adults. And they flourish in our communities and homes, where compassionate leaders leverage their talents and resources to enhance the well-being of our children.\nI am proud to share that, in collaboration with Secretary Turner at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Office of Management and Budget, I successfully secured a $25 million investment in the President’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget aimed at supporting youth transitioning out of foster care. This dedicated funding will provide rental assistance and vital services, fostering stability, independence, and hope for thousands of young people across our Nation.\nThis investment represents a significant milestone in my BE BEST initiative and underscores my unwavering commitment to Fostering the Future—because every child deserves a solid foundation upon which to build their dreams.\nHowever, our efforts must extend beyond this achievement. Just two days ago, I stood alongside the President in the Rose Garden as he signed the “Take It Down Act” into law. That moment was not only powerful but deeply emotional—culminating years of dedication from survivors, advocates, families, and many of your spouses in the Senate, all working tirelessly to shield children and youth from harmful online content.\nThe overwhelming bipartisan support for this legislation serves as a testament to what we can accomplish when we unite in the interest of our children. Together, we have equipped families with essential tools to safeguard their self-image and dignity in a digital landscape that often neglects these fundamental aspects.\nAs we move forward, let us continue to lead with empathy, foster collaboration, and create environments where all children feel safe and empowered. In our roles as spouses, mothers, and fathers, we embody a formidable force for good.\nI recently shared with military mothers at the White House: through our unwavering love and nurturing wisdom, we possess the ability to inspire, uplift, and shape the hearts of our children.\nThis power, rooted in compassion and strength, is a beacon of hope that illuminates the path for generations to come.\nWhen a Senator’s vision aligns with truth, the impact can resonate for generations. Throughout history, American lawmakers have shaped security, prosperity, and civil liberties. Congress wields significant influence over the nation’s character, starting with the preservation of human dignity. It is vital for us, as our spouses’ greatest supporters, to reaffirm the importance of truth and integrity. \nThank you.",

Trump in the White House Rose Garden for the signing of S.146, the “TAKE IT DOWN” Act, a historic and bipartisan new law focused on protecting children and families from online extortion and exploitation through the non-consensual distribution of intimate images and deepfake abuse.\nThe bill, a priority of the First Lady’s BE BEST initiative, passed Congress in the first 100 days of the second Trump Administration, marking a significant early legislative achievement for all Americans.\nFirst Lady Melania Trump said, “Today, through the ‘TAKE IT DOWN’ Act, we affirm that the well-being of our children is central to the future of our families and America. I am proud to say that the values of BE BEST will be reflected in the law of the land.”\nIn his remarks, President Trump commended First Lady Melania Trump for her work to help pass the “TAKE IT DOWN” Act, saying, “I want to thank Melania for your leadership on this very important issue. America is blessed to have such a dedicated and compassionate First Lady.” The President ended his remarks by saying, “working with our First Lady, we’ve shown that bipartisanship is still possible.”\nIn March 2025, Mrs. Trump convened a roundtable discussion on Capitol Hill, bringing together survivors of non-consensual intimate imagery, families, advocates for online protection, and Members of Congress to raise awareness about the issue. The President emphasized the importance of the bill in his Address to a Joint Session of Congress the next evening. Mrs. Trump and the Office of the First Lady continued to engage lawmakers during key stages of the legislative process, including consideration in the House Energy and Commerce Committee and final passage on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nToday’s signing ceremony brought together survivors and their families, Members of Congress, Cabinet officials, and advocates who contributed to the passage of this landmark legislation.\nFull Remarks by First Lady Melania Trump(As Prepared for Delivery)\nGood afternoon.\nIt’s an honor to join you here today for the signing of the “TAKE IT DOWN” Act—a national victory that will help parents and families protect children from online exploitation.\nThis legislation is a powerful step forward in our efforts to ensure that every American—especially our young people—can feel better protected from their image or identity being abused through non-consensual intimate imagery or NCII.\nArtificial Intelligence and social media are the digital candy of the next generation—sweet, addictive, and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children. But unlike sugar, these new technologies can be weaponized, shape beliefs, and sadly, affect emotions and even be deadly.\nOver the past few months, I have met with brave survivors, deeply-loving families, and caring advocates who know firsthand the emotional and psychological toll of NCII and deepfake abuse.\nElliston Berry stood boldly for change—despite the risks posed to her and her family by speaking out and making her voice heard. Elliston, your voice—and the voices of so many like you—made this bill a national priority.\nMany thanks to Members of Congress from both parties for passing this legislation, including Speaker Johnson, Senator Cruz, Senator Klobuchar, Congresswoman Salazar, Congresswoman Dean, and Congressman Guthrie. Thank you all for coming together to prioritize people over politics.\nAs First Lady, my BE BEST initiative is focused on improving children’s well-being, encouraging kindness, and creating a safer online environment for our youth. Today, I am proud to say that the values of BE BEST will be reflected in the law of the land.\nI want to thank my husband, President Trump, for standing with us in this effort. His signature on this new law is not where our work ends on this issue. Now, we look to the Federal Trade Commission and the private sector to do their part.\nToday, through the “TAKE IT DOWN” Act, we affirm that the well-being of our children is central to the future of our families and America.

      "content": "Remarks by Director Kratsios at the National Academy of Sciences \n\n\n\n\tThe White House\n\n\nMay 19, 2025 \n\n\n\n\nRemarks by Director Kratsios at the National Academy of Sciences\nREINVIGORATING AMERICA’S SCIENTIFIC ENTERPRISE\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 19, 2025\nTHE DIRECTOR: Thank you, Dr. McNutt, for that kind introduction, and for hosting me here today, in what can only be called a temple of science.\nI speak to you this morning as the President’s Science and Technology Advisor, who has been given three interconnected tasks in pursuit of a Golden Age of Innovation: to maintain American technological leadership; to ensure all Americans enjoy the fruit of transformative advances in science and technology; and, a mission I believe we all share, to revitalize America’s scientific enterprise.\nIn a speech last month, I explained how America’s dominant position in technology can only be maintained through a strategy of both promotion and protection. Today, I’d like to speak a little bit about our shared mission of furthering scientific advancement.\nTo empower America’s researchers to achieve groundbreaking discoveries and to reinvigorate our national science enterprise, we must scrutinize our existing approach and recommit ourselves to best practices. That is my commitment to you, but also what I ask of you, to ensure America sets the Gold Standard for science in this century and the next.\n***\nThe American story has been one of exploration and discovery, inseparable from the pioneering work of America’s scientists. From the tinkering inventor at his workbench to the great teams of men and women in white lab coats working across the country in common pursuit, they have labored to uncover the mysteries of creation and enabled us to build a free and prosperous republic.\nThe sweep of relentless U.S.-led scientific progress in the twentieth century flowed from Vannevar Bush’s 1945 “Science, The Endless Frontier” report, the blueprint for America’s joint Federal, corporate, and academic research effort. Bush not only provided a peacetime plan for furthering the technological developments of WWII, but planted a banner in the national imagination that in less than 25 years would become an American flag on the surface of the moon.\nBut as Dr. McNutt said in her inaugural State of the Science Speech last year, there is cause for declining confidence in continued American scientific leadership. While certain fields have seen tremendous advances in recent years, from the invention of transformers and CRISPR to the observation of graphene and gravitational waves, recent studies have found that papers and patents across the sciences have become less disruptive since 1980.\nWe are seeing diminishing returns. For example, despite biomedical research budgets soaring since the 1990s, scientific progress has stalled—new drug approvals have flatlined or even declined, more researchers are needed to achieve the same outputs, and workforce training has stagnated. More money has not meant more scientific discovery, and total dollars spent has not been a proxy for scientific impact.\nAs in scientific inquiry, when we uncover evidence that conflicts with our existing theories, we revise our theories and conduct further experiments to better understand the truth. This evidence of a scientific slowdown should spur us to experiment with new systems, new models, new ways of funding, conducting, and using science. As Dr. McNutt pointed out last year, since Dr. Bush’s report in 1945, the scientific enterprise has changed.\n***\nIn particular, there has been a profound shift in the balance of scientific funding. Today, industry spends more than three times on R&D than does the federal government, even self-funding more basic research than the Federal government funds at universities.\nEven as it alters the model that defined the last century, private money’s growing place in America’s scientific enterprise presents opportunities. In particular, in a period of fiscal constraints and geopolitical challenges, an increase in private funding can make it easier for federal grantmaking agencies to refocus public funds on basic research and the national interest.\nWhat we target is what we measure, and what we measure is what we get more of. To get more bang for America’s research bucks, we need to enhance the creativity and precision of our funding. Spending more money on the wrong things is far worse than spending less money on the right things.\nPrizes, challenges, public-private partnerships, and other novel funding mechanisms, can multiply the impact of targeted federal dollars. We must tie grants to clear strategic targets, while still allowing for the openness of scientific exploration, and so shape a general funding environment that makes clear what our national priorities are.\nThe money that goes to basic and blue-sky science must be used for that purpose, not to feed the red tape that so often goes along with funded research. We cannot resign our research community and the laboratory and university staff who support them to die the death of a thousand ten-minute tasks. To assist the nation’s scientists in their vocation, we will reduce administrative burdens on federally funded researchers, not bog them down in bureaucratic box checking.\n***\nBut in addition to taking a hard look at how we fund and supervise science, we should also consider how we, the people who make up the national discovery enterprise, can recapture that spirit of relentless focus and passionate pursuit of truth that underlies all our scientific progress.\nTwo brief cases will illustrate a need to recommit to what may be named Gold Standard Science. By this I mean research conforming to the principles to which we know great scientists aspire, but that are too often distorted by professional incentives and social pressures.  \nA painful episode involving Alzheimer’s research illustrates our vulnerability to scientific misconduct, especially when we fail to prioritize reproducibility, communication of error, and skepticism.\nIn 2009, a celebrated biotech executive published a paper in Nature that promised to revolutionize the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. In December of 2023, the journal retracted the research, acknowledging a number of anomalies and errors, but denying conscious fraud. The retraction came after almost 15 years of questions about the original paper being ignored and suppressed, during which the paper racked up over 800 citations, misdirected huge quantities of money, and helped the researcher become president of a premier university. The paper’s irreproducibility had been demonstrated by 2012, but it took a decade to be fully addressed.\nOur scientific enterprise should celebrate and incentivize checking each other’s work, rather than discourage questioning claims of progress.\nMeanwhile, the decision to shut down schools during the COVID-19 pandemic showed a failure to confront uncertainties or to integrate the knowledge of colleagues across multiple specializations. The best available scientific evidence indicated children were neither at high disease risk nor significant infection vectors. There was every reason to anticipate remote classes and masked communication would hurt children’s development. But a closed-ranks attitude led to policies that harmed America’s students.\nBiased interpretation of science leads to bad decision making and undermines the public’s trust.\n***\nThe first step to restoring trust in America’s scientific establishment, and rebuilding a strong foundation for breakthrough discoveries, is a return to Gold Standard Science. \nScientific progress advances in community and in the open, as findings are rigorously tested by others. Gold Standard Science is, therefore, first of all, reproducible and transparent. We cannot allow mistakes to persist unaddressed, poisoning the well of apparent knowledge for everyone else seeking to build on a given finding, as in the Alzheimer’s research case. To further enable this, researchers must proactively communicate errors and uncertainties. Only through this openness can each generation stand firmly on the shoulders of the giants that came before it.\nThe best environment for truly groundbreaking basic research, moreover, is collaborative and interdisciplinary. As the accumulated body of general science grows decade over decade, basic epistemic humility requires relying on the expertise of colleagues outside one’s particular specializations. But even with confidence in the skill and knowledge of collaborators, the best scientist remains skeptical of a team’s findings and is conscious of the ever present need to interrogate one’s assumptions. Better practice of these principles might have saved America’s children the catastrophic disruption of pandemic school closures.\nTo reinforce all of these individual virtues, Gold Standard Science is structured for falsifiability, subject to unbiased peer review, accepting of negative results as positive outcomes, and closed to conflicts of interest. Funders of research, whether in government, the academy, or industry, need to come alongside our best researchers to ensure that projects conform to these highest standards.\n***\nAt the heart of the practices that make up Gold Standard Science is a suspicion of blind consensus and a celebration of informed dissent. For the crisis of confidence in scientists stems from fear that political biases are displacing the vital search for truth.\nDEI initiatives, in particular, degrade our scientific enterprise. DEI represents an existential threat to the real diversity of thought that forms the foundation of the scientific community. Diversity of thought is essential to scientific inquiry, empowering us to challenge entrenched assumptions and offer novel approaches to solving complex problems.\nAs we seek new paradigms in fundamental science, we cannot afford for America’s scientists to be in the business of scoring points for an ideological agenda. A closed-minded political fashion preoccupied with symbolic victories divides colleagues and distorts grant application and research design.\nFor example, until recently at NASA—an institution whose mission is to explore the unknown in air and space, innovate for the benefit of humanity, and inspire the world through discovery—research proposals were required to include plans for furthering “inclusion goals.” Evaluation panels for these proposals were to be 50 percent “DEI professionals.” Such requirements undermine merit-based assessment of scientists, add to administrative burdens, and distract from essential, productive work.\nScience cannot be subject to ideology, nor should scientists march blindly in lockstep.\nBlindly trusting in The Science, with a capital T and capital S, is inimical to free inquiry and open debate and is thus the enemy of scientific progress. The beginning of knowledge is the knowledge of ignorance. We seek to know, despite human limitations, and to move upward from mere opinion to the truth. It is convention, dogma, and intellectual fad that resist revision and correction.\n***\nI believe all of us in this room share the same mission. We want America’s scientists to be the best in the world. We want to empower them to make the awe-inspiring breakthroughs that will solve tough challenges and inspire our young people to follow in their footsteps, and we want to help repair the relationship between the scientific establishment and our fellow citizens.\nI believe that this is not something that government, or industry, can do alone; the pioneering scientific enterprise Vannevar Bush built still depends on a partnership, and America’s national laboratories and universities are its crown jewels.\nWe will have to work together to restore this partnership, and revitalize America’s scientific enterprise.\nWith a renewed focus on Gold Standard Science, we can take the first steps to revolutionizing the way America conducts the business of discovery. And though this is a call to excellence for all of America’s scientists—in labs, in the field, and in offices across the country—it begins with me and my colleagues in government. Implementing Gold Standard Science starts in the policies and programs of Federal agencies.\nIf we in government enable scientists to spend less time in the office completing administrative tasks and more time in the lab exploring scientific frontiers; if we adjust to new realities and creatively partner with industry and philanthropy; if we reject political fads and recommit ourselves to the truth: I believe we will reignite the American spirit that lit the world with Edison’s bulb, lifted the Wright brothers into the sky, and landed Armstrong on the moon.\nThank you.",

Moreover, the Make America Healthy Again Commission was established to address the root causes of our Nation’s health crisis—from poor nutrition and chronic diseases to preventable conditions – issues impacting women across the nation.  By advancing food transparency, promoting physical fitness, and restoring health education, we are working to give women, and all Americans, stronger futures and better quality of life. My Administration is confronting the high cost of healthcare, which places a tremendous toll on American families.  We are working to improve price transparency, stop surprise billing, and ensure patients have clear information about their coverage before receiving care.  Historic steps have been taken to lower prescription drug prices, including capping the cost of insulin and expanding access to low-cost generics.  By holding providers accountable and putting patients first, we are lowering costs, improving care delivery, and restoring fairness to the American healthcare system.  This week, we reaffirm our commitment to improve women’s health so that they may live fuller and healthier lives, ensuring that all generations of American women thrive and continue to drive the success of our Nation.",

On May 10, 1775, our Nation’s forefathers convened the Second Continental Congress—a historic body that would go on to adopt the Declaration of Independence, the grandest and most important political document ever put to pen. Following the famous “shot heard ‘round the world” at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775—the first major armed hostilities of the Revolutionary War, in which the British Army attempted to seize American military supplies and arrest American leaders—it became clear to the patriots that their conflict with the British Crown had escalated beyond mere disagreement.  Despite the colonists’ tireless efforts on behalf of peace, war was all but certain.  In the wake of the Boston Massacre, the imposition of the Intolerable Acts, and the lasting injustice of taxation without representation, Americans had formed the First Continental Congress in the fall of 1774 to seek redress for their grievances.  By the spring of 1775, following the lives taken at Lexington and Concord, a new Congress was convened—and America’s righteous crusade for independence was formally underway. Comprised of true American titans like John and Samuel Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, James Madison, John Jay, and George Washington—whom Congress later appointed as the Commander in Chief of the Continental Army—the Second Continental Congress was made up of some of the boldest, fiercest, and most visionary men ever to walk the face of the Earth.  This remarkable body would go on to preside over the Revolutionary War, establish critical international alliances, and maintain unity among the 13 Colonies as America secured its independence and ultimately emerged as a new Nation. The Second Continental Congress set in motion our independence, our venerated political traditions, and the birth of the greatest Republic ever created.  As we commemorate 250 years since its first convening, we recommit to the ideals of our Nation’s founding.  We summon the courage of our Founding Fathers.  Above all, as we approach 250 years of glorious independence, we proudly invoke the spirit of 1776 to build a proud, hopeful, and radiant future.",

In recognition of the seventh anniversary of Mrs. Trump’s BE BEST initiative, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) allocated funds toward the Agency’s Foster Youth to Independence program (FYI).\n“I am proud to have successfully secured $25 million to provide housing for individuals aging out of foster care.  This is another essential measure that ensures the safety, welfare, and autonomy of those in the foster community,” commented First Lady Melania Trump.\nThe First Lady continued, “Secretary Scott Turner’s commitment will provide thousands of youth transitioning out of the foster care system with dedicated rental assistance and other supportive services to promote stability and self-sufficiency.”\n“This dedicated funding for foster youth is a game changer in providing young adults with access to short-term housing assistance and supportive services, which will prevent homelessness. I am so appreciative of the First Lady’s efforts, for her commitment to helping our Nation’s foster youth through her BE BEST initiative and for championing public-private partnerships that are changing lives every day,” said HUD Secretary Scott Turner.\nFirst Lady Melania Trump has been actively supporting the foster care community through Fostering the Future, a BE BEST initiative, for several years.  The announcement of this important investment coincides with National Foster Care Month and reflects the First Lady’s ongoing commitment to promoting children’s well-being and supporting youth through Be Best.\nAbout the Foster Youth to Independence Program (FYI)\nThe FYI program, led by HUD and supported by public housing authorities across the country, offers housing assistance to eligible individuals under the age of 25 who are transitioning out of foster care. The program is designed to prevent homelessness and provide a foundation for young adults to pursue education, employment, and long-term independence.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, more than 20,000 young people transition out of foster care each year. A significant percentage of these youth face housing insecurity or homelessness. This support provides an essential safety net during a pivotal time in a young person’s life.\nFor additional information, read a recent press release from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development here.\nBackground on BE BEST Launched by Mrs. Trump in 2018, BE BEST is dedicated to promoting the well-being of children with a renewed emphasis on supporting foster youth through initiatives like Fostering the Future.

Trump and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer committed to deliver shared prosperity for American and British citizens alike. Our governments have a unique opportunity to enhance our economic partnership through the U.S.-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD).\nA first of its kind, the United States and the United Kingdom expect the EPD to address three core objectives, based on fairness and reciprocity:\n\nTo grow the quality and volume of mutually beneficial trade between the United States and the United Kingdom, creating good, high-paying jobs and growth in both countries;\nTo remove barriers to make it easier for American and British businesses to operate, invest and trade in both countries; and\nTo ensure that the Special Relationship is rooted in an enduring economic partnership that is fair, reciprocal, future-facing, and built on a shared vision of the challenges that face our economies.\n\nThis document serves to define the general terms for the EPD that set forth the shared desires of the United States and the United Kingdom to make bilateral trade fairer, easier, and more substantial. Alongside this document covering our trading relationship, we are continuing discussions toward a transformative technology partnership between our countries.\nThe United States and United Kingdom are immediately beginning negotiations of the EPD to develop and formalize the proposals made in this document. Once the initial proposals have been formalized and implemented, the United States and United Kingdom understand that the EPD can further be expanded over time to cover additional areas. Each country intends to continue to improve market access under the EPD.\nBoth the United States and the United Kingdom recognize that this document does not constitute a legally binding agreement.\n\nAddressing Tariffs(a) Following a reasonable period of negotiation: (i) the United Kingdom intends to reduce its applied tariff rates on a preferential basis on a range of originating goods of the United States in sectors of importance to the United States; and (ii) the United States intends to reduce its applied tariff rates on a preferential basis on a range of originating goods of the United Kingdom in sectors of importance to the United Kingdom. The countries intend to coordinate the timing of their respective tariff reductions to be as soon as practicable, taking into consideration their respective domestic processes. On request of the United Kingdom, the United States will consider reducing its applied tariff rates for a UK territory or territories for whose international relations the United Kingdom is responsible on a preferential basis.(b) U.S. beef exports to the United Kingdom are currently subject to a 20 percent tariff within a quota of 1,000 metric tons (mt). The United Kingdom will remove the 20 percent tariff. Additionally, the United Kingdom will create a preferential duty-free quota of 13,000 mt for U.S. beef. In return, the United States will reallocate to the United Kingdom 13,000 mt of its existing “Other Countries” tariff rate quota (TRQ) for beef. Additionally, the United Kingdom will offer a preferential duty-free TRQ of 1.4 billion liters for U.S. ethanol.(c) The United States intends to provide certain key UK imports with modified reciprocal tariff treatment, based on our balanced trading relationship and shared national security priorities. Any such modifications will be consistent with those shared national security priorities, including priorities identified in future U.S. Section 232 investigations.(i) The United States will create a quota of 100,000 vehicles for UK automotive imports at a 10 percent tariff rate, and an accompanying arrangement for attendant auto parts for such autos.(ii) The United Kingdom will work to promptly meet U.S. requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminum products intended for export to the United States and on the nature of ownership of relevant production facilities. Understanding the United Kingdom will meet these requirements, the United States will promptly construct a quota at most favored nation (MFN) rates for UK steel and aluminum and certain derivative steel and aluminum products.(iii) Contingent on the findings of the U.S. Section 232 investigation on pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, and consistent with the United Kingdom’s compliance with the supply chains security requirements described in subparagraph (ii), the United States and the United Kingdom intend to promptly negotiate significantly preferential treatment outcomes on pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients. The United Kingdom confirms that it will endeavor to improve the overall environment for pharmaceutical companies operating in the United Kingdom.(iv) In addition to products already addressed in this document, the United States and the United Kingdom intend to adopt a structured, negotiated approach to othersectors that may be subject to Section 232 investigations or other tariff measures with a view to a significantly preferential outcome. Any such approach is contingent on the United Kingdom ensuring the security of supply chains, using appropriate measures, of products intended for export to the United States and on the findings of related U.S. investigations of, or other tariff measures related to, such sectors.(d) To ensure U.S. and UK firms can benefit from these changes in practice, both countries intend to apply rules of origin that maximize bilateral trade and prevent non-participants from using our bilateral arrangement to circumvent tariffs. The United States affirms that it intends to take into consideration during the negotiations of the EPD the United Kingdom’s request that the United States continues to work to lower tariffs on UK goods imposed by U.S. executive authority as well as those subject to Congressional approval.\n\n\nAddressing Non-Tariff Barriers(a) The United Kingdom and the United States plan to work constructively in an effort to enhance agricultural market access. Further, both countries positively support future discussions to strengthen bilateral agricultural trade. The United Kingdom and the United States affirm that imported food and agricultural goods must comply with the importing country’s sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards and other mutually agreed standards. The United Kingdom and the United States commit to working together to improve market access for agricultural products, to highlight concerns, and to increase agricultural cooperation on areas such as certain export verification programs to facilitate greater trade, and more formal bilateral engagement through international standard setting bodies.(b) The United Kingdom and the United States each confirms its intent to accord to conformity assessment bodies of the other treatment no less favorable than that it accords to conformity assessment bodies located in its own territory. Treatment under this paragraph includes procedures, criteria, fees, and other conditions relating to accrediting, approving, licensing, or otherwise recognizing conformity assessment bodies.(c) Both countries intend to build on an existing set of Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) by negotiating additional agreements, as appropriate, across certain industrial goods and advance toward an agreement on services domestic regulation.(d) The United Kingdom and United States intend to discuss the principles and criteria used in order to recognize a standard as an international standard. The United Kingdom and the United States will further commit to discuss respective applicable standards for mutually agreed sectors of interest and, within those specified sectors, to agree which of the other’s relevant domiciled standards development organizations (SDOs) currently meet recognized international principles.\n\n\nIncreasing Digital Trade(a) Both countries confirm that they will negotiate an ambitious set of digital trade provisions that will include within its scope services, including financial services.(b) Both countries confirm that they will negotiate provisions on paperless trade, pre-arrival processing, and digitalized procedures for the movement of goods between our countries.\n\n\nStrengthening Alignment and Collaboration on Economic Security(a) Both countries intend to strengthen cooperation on economic security, including by coordinating to address non-market policies of third countries.(b) Both countries intend to cooperate on the effective use of investment security measures, export controls, and ICT vendor security, building on the current levels of close alignment on trade and investment security measures.(c) In order to ensure more competitive, reciprocal, and secure access to our procurement markets, both countries reaffirm their procurement commitments under the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) and their respective free trade agreements, and intend to discuss the implementation of our respective procurement commitments, including through the United Kingdom’s new National Security Unit for Procurement and the United Kingdom’s new powers under the Procurement Act 2023, which provides that non-“treaty states” are not guaranteed non-discriminatory treatment in procurement.(d) Both countries confirm that they will negotiate as part of the EPD provisions on duty evasion customs cooperation to combat evasion schemes and the illegal transshipment of goods from countries subject to antidumping, countervailing duties, safeguards, etc., which undermine economic security.\n\n\nCommercial Considerations and OpportunitiesBoth countries commit to continuing to identify mutually beneficial goods, services, investment opportunities and commercial transactions that serve to increase economic integration in critical industries and defense preparedness, leveraging government policies, licenses, and programs and private-sector participation to facilitate such transactions.\n\n\nOther Matters(a) Both countries confirm that they intend to discuss high-standard commitments related to intellectual property rights protection and enforcement, labor practices (including addressing forced labor in supply chains), and environmental policies and practices.(b) The United Kingdom will consider the interests of those UK territories for whose international relations it is responsible.(c) The United Kingdom and the United States recognize that the purpose of this arrangement is to deepen our trade relationship based on mutual trust and a shared commitment to fair and reciprocal trade. On request of either country, the United Kingdom and the United States will consult with a view to considering any changes that may need to be made to this arrangement to ensure that it remains mutually beneficial.(d) The United States or the United Kingdom may terminate this arrangement by giving written notice to the other. The United Kingdom and the United States further plan to discuss procedures for review and termination as part of the negotiations of the EPD.\n\nThis document becomes operative on May 8, 2025.",

Surrounded by members of the Bush family, friends, former Bush staff, and distinguished guests, Mrs. Trump delivered remarks highlighting Barbara Bush’s enduring impact on the Nation and her steadfast devotion to family, literacy, and service.\n“Barbara’s unwavering conviction, dignity, and deep loyalty to her loved ones have left an indelible mark on our hearts and history,” said First Lady Melania Trump. “The unveiling of this commemorative stamp honors Barbara Bush’s contributions as First Lady and her enduring impact on our Nation. May this tribute inspire us to lead with compassion, act with strength, and uphold the values that direct us toward a meaningful existence.”\nMrs. Trump was joined by Doro Bush Koch, daughter of Barbara Bush; Alice Yates, CEO of the George & Barbara Bush Foundation; and Judy de Torok, Vice President of Corporate Affairs at the U.S. Postal Service, who all joined in emphasizing Mrs. Bush’s legacy as a trailblazer whose commitment to literacy and family influenced the role of First Lady and left a lasting imprint on American society.\nThe Office of First Lady Melania Trump extended its sincere appreciation to all participating organizations and individuals who made this tribute possible, including the White House Historical Association for contributing the official portrait of First Lady Barbara Bush for the commemorative stamp.\nFull remarks of First Lady Melania Trump as prepared for delivery:\nThank you, Doro, for the beautiful introduction and welcome back to the White House as we honor the life and legacy of your mother, First Lady Barbara Bush. Barbara’s unwavering conviction, dignity, and deep loyalty to her loved ones have left an indelible mark on our hearts and history. Your mother’s values can be seen in her family, friends, and former staff who also join us here today, and continue her legacy.\nMany thanks to Alice Yates, CEO of the George & Barbara Bush Foundation, for joining us today. Along with the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, you are helping current and future generations to navigate the world with confidence and dignity.\nAnd, I would like to thank the White House Historical Association and the United States Postal Service, especially Judy de Torok, who made today’s event possible.  \nStrong American families are the foundation of a healthy society and serve as a stepping-stone towards building a better world. The dynamics within American households shape our Nation’s core values, strengths, and collective wisdom.\nIt is within the privacy of our homes that the principles of morality, ambition, and empathy take root. The family unit serves as our first line of foresight, often more influential than the decisions made in Washington, D.C.\nBarbara Bush’s iconic commencement address at Wellesley College in 1990 remains an important moment in the conversation surrounding women’s roles in society. Her message, which emphasized the importance of family and personal integrity, encouraged women to carve their own paths in life.\nMrs. Bush exclaimed, “Your success as a family—our success as a society—depends not on what happens in the White House, but on what happens inside your house.” The First Lady further inspired her audience by highlighting the importance of pursuing personal dreams, stating, “The winner of the hoop race will be the first to realize her dream. Not society’s dreams, her own personal dream. Who knows—somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House, and I wish him well.”\nOver 35 years have passed since Barbara Bush made the call for a female American president, a reflection of her forward-thinking vision. As a devoted mother and one of only two First Ladies whose son also ascended to the presidency, she embodied the complex interplay of ambition and identity that defines us all.\nMrs. Bush’s legacy is marked by her respect for tradition while also breaking with convention. While she is known for championing literacy, she also supported women’s empowerment, changed the national conversation on AIDS, and took a stance supporting gay rights.\nI applaud Mrs. Bush’s mark defending our society’s vital need for women across all avenues, whether CEO or homemaker. We have, can, and will build better families and run innovative businesses at the same time, ultimately shaping a brighter future.\nThe unveiling of this commemorative stamp honors Barbara Bush’s contributions as First Lady and her enduring impact on our Nation. May this tribute inspire us to lead with compassion, act with strength, and uphold the values that direct us toward a meaningful existence.",

Speaking from the White House with her husband, President Donald Trump, by her side, First Lady Melania Trump reflected on the transformative nature of motherhood, the strength of women, and the enduring legacy mothers create through love, sacrifice, and care.\nHighlighting the parallel paths of military mothers and the American spirit, she praised their unmatched grace, resilience, and quiet determination. Mrs. Trump also called on women to prioritize their own well-being as an essential part of empowering future generations.\nThe full text of the First Lady’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, follows below.\nFirst Lady Melania Trump’s Remarks at a Celebration of Military Mothers\nMotherhood: The life-changing event that makes women invincible and exposed at the same time. It’s remarkable, really, that my son’s life creates unimaginable, unpredictable concerns and thrills for me, even until this day.\nAll caring mothers understand this rare feeling. Nothing against fathers, of course, but in my opinion, and I am sure everyone in this room agrees—only a mother can grasp this particular point.\nMilitary Mothers and America, together, have developed an extraordinary, parallel journey. They are filled with stories of personal sacrifice, determination, loss, and healing. Certainly, only military mothers have experienced this level of grace and resilience, of American life.\nAnd finally, aging—a sudden shift in family dynamics, an unexpected positioning change in life when caretakers become the caregivers. If this has happened within your family, you understand the precious nature of motherhood.\nHere now, in the White House, at this pivotal moment, I urge you to prioritize your well-being. Nurture yourself, for your strength is the bedrock of a brighter future for our children. By caring for ourselves, we empower the next generation to thrive. Together, let’s build a legacy of resilience and hope. Your journey matters. Embrace it!\nAnd indeed, the sacred strength of women is a profound force. With unwavering love and nurturing wisdom, we have the ability to inspire, uplift, and shape the future hearts of our children. This power, rooted in compassion and resilience, is a beacon of hope that lights the way for generations to come.\nLet us unite to honor the beauty of motherhood, champion the grace of our journey, and inspire those who follow.\nA mother’s love and wisdom empower our children to flourish, instilling in them the courage to reach their fullest potential.\nMotherhood.

I acknowledge the tireless dedication of our American foster families who play a critical role in helping children realize their full potential.”\nFirst Lady Melania Trump’s Be Best initiative supports children’s well-being, including individuals within the foster care community, through her Fostering the Future platform.

      "content": "The White House Office of Management and Budget Releases the President’s Fiscal Year 2026 Skinny Budget\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tThe White House\n\n\nMay 2, 2025 \n\n\n\n\nWashington, D.C.–Today, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) sent President Trump’s topline discretionary Budget request for fiscal year 2026 to the U.S. Congress.\nThe Budget, which reduces non-defense discretionary by $163 billion or 23 percent from the 2025 enacted level, guts a weaponized deep state while providing historic increases for defense and border security.  The Budget also provides support for air and rail safety as well as key infrastructure and our Nation’s veterans and law enforcement.\nThis is the lowest non-defense spending level since 2017.  Savings come from eliminating radical diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and critical race theory programs, Green New Scam funding, large swaths of the Federal Government weaponized against the American people, and moving programs that are better suited for States and localities to provide. \nDefense spending would increase by 13 percent, and appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security would increase by nearly 65 percent, to ensure that our military and other agencies repelling the invasion of our border have the resources they need to complete the mission.  These increases will be made possible through the passage of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, which will be enacted with a simple majority in the Congress, and not be held hostage by Democrats for wasteful spending increases that have been the status quo in Washington.\n“For decades, the biggest complaint about the Federal Budget was wasteful spending and bloated bureaucracy.  But over the last four years, Government spending aggressively turned against the American people and trillions of our dollars were used to fund cultural Marxism, radical Green New Scams, and even our own invasion.  No agency was spared in the Left’s taxpayer-funded cultural revolution.  At this critical moment, we need a historic Budget—one that ends the funding of our decline, puts Americans first, and delivers unprecedented support to our military and homeland security.  The President’s Budget does all of that,” said Russ Vought, Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\nHighlights of the President’s key priorities include the following:\nEnd Weaponization and Reduce Violent Crime.  The Budget ends the previous Administration’s weaponization of the Government by eliminating programs like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s disinformation offices that targeted and censored Americans, eliminating so-called Fair Housing programs that waged war on America’s suburbs, ending the Environmental Protection Agency’s unfair harassment of citizens over “environmental justice” directives, and halting the ATF’s criminalizing of gun-owning Americans and instead, focusing on stopping illegal firearms traffickers and violent gang members.\nThe Budget prioritizes Department of Justice (DOJ) key functions—restoring law and order to America’s communities, fighting crime, and supporting America’s men and women in Blue.  To that end, the Budget proposes to eliminate more than 40 DOJ grant programs that fund things like a “feminist, culturally specific nonprofit” to address “structural racism and toxic masculinities” and training Fa’afafine advocates—an organization of biological men that describes themselves as a “third-gender” in Samoa.  The Budget also reflects the President’s priority of reducing violent crime in American cities and protecting national security by getting Federal Bureau of Investigation agents into the field. \nDefund the Harmful Woke, Marxist Agenda.  Every single agency across the Federal Government was engaged in funding and advancing DEI and other radical, harmful ideologies such as:  $315 million for grant programs to push “intersectionality,” “racial equity,” and LGBTQIA+ programming for preschoolers; housing grants that funded activities such as an “Equity Audit” to reverse “land use patterns that have roots in systemically racist policies in L.A. County; and “addressing White Supremacy in the STEM profession.”  The Budget ends all of that.\nSecure the Border.  The Budget request empowers the Department of Homeland Security to implement the President’s mass removal campaign and secure the border.  This funding is in addition to historic investments in border security the Administration proposes to provide through mandatory funding, as part of the congressional Budget reconciliation process.  The discretionary request includes an additional $500 million for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expedite the removal of illegal aliens through the support of 50,000 detention beds, $766 million to procure cutting-edge border security technology funding, and funding to maintain 22,000 Border Patrol Agents and hire additional Customs and Border Protection officers for a total of 26,383 officers.  The Budget also cuts off the flow of taxpayer funds that have been abused to facilitate migrant caravan invasions.  Departments whose task it was to prevent those invasions allocated billions in funding to non-governmental organizations running “border aid stations” and legal services to criminal aliens—all of which will be eliminated under this new budget.\nRealign Foreign Aid.  The Budget ensures that foreign aid spending is efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.  The Budget reorganizes the U.S. Agency for International Development into the Department of State to meet current needs and eliminates non-essential staff that were hired based on DEI and preferencing practices.  The Budget also expands the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to support U.S. national security and American interests—generating returns to the taxpayer and reducing reliance on foreign aid.  This includes $3 billion for a new revolving fund to allow DFC to recycle any realized returns from its initial investments.\nRebuild our Nation’s Military.  The Budget request for the Department of Defense builds on the President’s promise to achieve peace through strength by providing the resources to rebuild our military, re-establish deterrence, and revive the warrior ethos of our Armed Forces.  In combination with $119 billion in mandatory funding, the Budget increases Defense spending by 13 percent, and prioritizes investments to strengthen the safety, security, and sovereignty of the homeland, deter Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific, and revitalize our defense industrial base. \nAchieve American Energy Dominance.  The Budget supports the President’s commitment to unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources.  The Budget cancels over $15 billion in Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) Green New Scam funds provided to the Department of Energy for unreliable renewable energy, removing carbon dioxide from the air, and other costly technologies that burden ratepayers and consumers.  The Budget reorients Department of Energy funding toward research and development of technologies that could produce an abundance of domestic fossil energy and critical minerals, innovative concepts for nuclear reactors and advanced nuclear fuels, and technologies that promote firm baseload power.  The Budget also cancels an additional $5.7 billion in IIJA funding provided to the Department of Transportation for failed electric vehicle charger grant programs.\nMake America Healthy Again (MAHA).  The Budget request builds on the President’s MAHA Commission.  The Budget provides resources to the Department of Health and Human Services that would allow the Secretary to tackle issues related to nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles, over-reliance on medication and treatments, the effects of new technological habits, environmental impacts, and food and drug quality and safety.  The Budget also supports the creation of MAHA food boxes, that would be filled with commodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households.  The Budget includes resources to ensure food safety nationwide, including support for increased production and demand for services.\nSupport Our Veterans.  The Budget provides increased funding for healthcare services tailored to U.S. veterans’ needs, both at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers and in the community.  Combined with $50 billion in mandatory funding from the Toxic Exposures Fund, the Budget ensures that the Nation’s veterans are provided with the world-class healthcare that they deserve.  In addition, veterans who qualify for access to care with local community providers would be empowered to make the choice to see them, rather than having to drive in some cases hours to access the nearest VA facility.  The Budget includes $1.1 billion in new VA funding to make a down payment on President Trump’s commitment to eradicate veterans’ homelessness, the largest funding increase in the last decade.\nPreserve Social Security.  The Budget supports the President’s promise to not touch Social Security benefits.  It also includes sufficient resources for the Social Security Administration (SSA) to improve customer service by expanding and improving online services, and reducing customer wait times in field offices and on the phone.  The Budget also includes investments in program integrity, to reduce fraud and abuse in Social Security programs, and in investments in artificial intelligence to increase employee productivity and automate routine workloads.  These efforts would help ensure that SSA delivers timely and accurate Social Security services to the public.\nStreamline K-12 Education Funding and Promote Parental Choice.  The Budget continues the process of shutting down the Department of Education.  The Budget maintains full funding for Title I, that provides Federal financial assistance to school districts for children from low-income families, and special education funding under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  To limit the Federal role in education, and provide States with more flexibility, the Budget creates a new K-12 Simplified Funding Program that consolidates 18 competitive and formula grant programs into a new formula grant, and a Special Education Simplified Funding Program that consolidates seven IDEA programs into a single grant.  The Budget also invests $500 million, a $60 million increase, to expand the number of high-quality charter schools, that have a proven track record of improving students’ academic achievement and giving parents more choice in the education of their children.\nMake America Skilled Again (MASA).  The Budget proposes to give States and localities the flexibility to spend Federal workforce dollars to best support their workers and economies, instead of funneling taxpayer dollars to progressive non-profits finding work for illegal immigrants or focusing on DEI.  Under this proposal, States would now have more control and flexibility to coordinate with employers and would have to spend at least 10 percent of their MASA grant on apprenticeship, a proven model that trains workers while they earn a paycheck and offers a valuable alternative to college. \nSupport Space Flight.  The Budget refocuses the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) funding on beating China back to the Moon and on putting the first human on Mars.  By allocating over $7 billion for lunar exploration and introducing $1 billion in new investments for Mars-focused programs, it ensures that America’s human space exploration efforts remain unparalleled, innovative, and efficient.  To achieve these objectives, the Budget would streamline the NASA workforce, IT services, NASA Center operations, facility maintenance, and construction and environmental compliance activities.  The Budget also eliminates “green aviation” and other climate scam programs as well as failing space propulsion projects.\nMaintain Support for Tribal Nations.  The Budget preserves Federal funding for the Indian Health Service and supports core programs at the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau of Indian Education, sustaining the Federal Government’s support for core programs that benefit tribal communities.  The Budget also weeds out radical woke grants and programs and streamlines other programs for tribal communities that were ineffective.\nAddress Drug Abuse.  The Administration is committed to combatting the scourge of deadly drugs that have ravaged American communities.  The Budget prioritizes Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) resources on traffickers of fentanyl and other dangerous drugs that are driving America’s overdose crisis.  This includes redirecting DEA’s foreign spending to regions with criminal organizations that traffic significant quantities of deadly drugs into the United States—Mexico, Central America, South America, and China. \nSupport Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Research.  The Budget amply funds research in artificial intelligence and quantum information science at key agencies to ensure the United States remains on the cutting edge of these critical technologies’ development and responsible use.\nImprove Wildland Firefighting.  Federal wildfire responsibilities currently are split across five agencies in two departments.  The Budget would consolidate firefighting responsibilities into a new Federal Wildland Fire Service at the Department of the Interior that would coordinate with non-Federal partners to combat the wildfire crisis.",

I am honored to have contributed to guiding it through Congress,” said Mrs. Melania Trump.\nThe First Lady thanked House Republican leadership for expediting this bill and commended Members from both parties who voted to protect young Americans from malicious digital content. This significant achievement aligns with her ‘Be Best’ initiative and represents a bipartisan effort to safeguard children from the dangers of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) and deepfake exploitation online.\n“Today’s bipartisan passage of the Take It Down Act is a powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of our children. I am thankful to the Members of Congress—both in the House and Senate—who voted to protect the well-being of our youth. Through this critical legislation and our continued focus with ‘Be Best,’ we are building a future where every child can thrive and achieve their full potential,” said First Lady Melania Trump.\nThe Take It Down Act, which passed with strong bipartisan support, will now head to President Donald J. Trump’s desk for signature. The President previously voiced his support for the bill during his 2025 Address to a Joint Session of Congress.\nBackground:\nFirst Lady Melania Trump has been a vocal advocate for online protection since launching her ‘Be Best’ initiative, which is centered around promoting child well-being. In March 2025, Mrs. Trump hosted a high-profile roundtable discussion on Capitol Hill alongside lawmakers, NCII survivors, and advocates for online protection to build momentum for the Take It Down Act.\nDuring the roundtable, the First Lady asserted, “As organizations harness the power of our data, the risk of unauthorized access and misuse of personal information escalates. We must prioritize robust security measures and uphold strict ethical standards to protect individual privacy.” Mrs. Trump and others shared powerful stories of young survivors of NCII, calling on Congress to act swiftly to pass this critical legislation. Prior to its passage on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, the bill passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 8, 2025. The Office of the First Lady released a statement celebrating committee passage.  The U.S. Senate version of the bill passed the Senate chamber on February 13, 2025.",

On this Day of Remembrance, we again join the Great Armenian Community in America, and around the World, in mourning the many lives that were lost. Every year on April 24th, we reflect on the strong and enduring ties between the American and Armenian peoples. We are proud of the American Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief, a groundbreaking effort established in 1915 that provided crucial humanitarian support to Armenian Refugees, and grateful for the thousands of Americans who contributed or volunteered to help the Armenians expelled from their homes. On this day, we bear witness to the strength and resiliency of the Armenian people in the face of tragedy. We are fortunate that so many Armenians have brought their rich culture to our shores, and contributed so much to our Country, including decorated soldiers, celebrated entertainers, renowned architects, and successful business people. As we honor the memory of those lost, my Administration remains committed to safeguarding religious freedom and protecting vulnerable minorities. We look forward to continuing our strategic partnership with Armenia, and upholding regional stability as we continue to pursue enduring prosperity and security.",

Trump and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni held their first official meeting yesterday in Washington, D.C., where they confirmed their resolve to promote a mutually beneficial relationship and further strengthen the U.S. – Italy strategic alliance across security, economic, and technological issues.U.S.- Italy Cooperation for SecurityThe U.S. and Italy underscore that the war in Ukraine must end, and fully endorse President Trump’s leadership in brokering a ceasefire and delivering a just and lasting peace.     The U.S. and Italy reiterate the unwavering commitment to NATO and to the principle of developing their collective and individual capacity to contribute to the Alliance’s goals. We therefore commit to ensuring our national security and defense are aligned and funded to meet the challenges of today, and critically, the risks of tomorrow.     Our defense cooperation must rely on a deep and extensive transatlantic supply chain. We are facing a complex security environment, and we are ready to further increase defense equipment and technology cooperation, including co-production and co-development that strengthen U.S. and Italian defense industrial capacity and protect it from foreign adversaries.     The U.S. and Italy reaffirm their shared commitment to counter illegal immigration and to ensure that legal migration is used as a tool to benefit our nations and not to create a security problem for our citizens. We will step up our common efforts to eradicate international organized crime groups engaged in migrant smuggling and human trafficking.     The U.S. and Italy confirm their joint effort to fight the production, distribution, and sale of illicit synthetic drugs, especially synthetic opioids and the criminal networks trafficking these drugs, which collectively damage the health, security, and well-being of our citizens and people around the world.U.S. – Italy Cooperation for Shared ProsperityThe United States and Italy agree to work to ensure that trade between the United States and Europe is mutually beneficial, fair, and reciprocal.     We highlight the importance of information technology to enabling free enterprise across the Atlantic. We agreed that a non-discriminatory environment in terms of digital services taxation is necessary to enable investments from cutting-edge tech companies.     We welcome American investments in AI computing and cloud services in Italy to maximize the opportunities of digital transformation and support Italy as the key regional data hub for the Mediterranean and North Africa.      Developing a workforce that can deliver on the needs of our economies is vital. The United States and Italy are proud partners in industrial endeavors that will benefit employment in both countries, playing a vital role for each other’s supply chains and strengthening our industrial bases. Italy will contribute to the maritime renaissance of the U.S. shipbuilding sector, while the U.S. will look into the investment opportunities offered by the increasingly positive Italian business environment, including through the incentives granted by the new Single Special Economic Zone (SEZ) established in Italy.     The U.S. and Italy cooperate to strengthen energy security by further encouraging the diversification of Italy’s energy supply source and by increasing exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Italy in a mutually beneficial manner.     The U.S. and Italy will work together to develop the India–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor, one of the greatest economic integration and connectivity projects of this century, connecting partners by ports, railways, and undersea cables and stimulating economic development and integration from India, to the Gulf to Israel, to Italy, and onward to the United States.      Following the example of the President Trump’s successful Abraham Accords approach, the U.S. and Italy will cooperate on crucial infrastructural projects and consider leveraging on the Mattei Plan’s potential.U.S. – Italy Cooperation for TechnologyThe United States and Italy recognize the need to protect our national critical and sensitive infrastructure and technology, which is why we commit to using only trusted vendors in these networks. There is no higher trust than our strategic alliance, which is why there can be no discrimination when it comes to U.S. and Italian vendors.     We are proud to partner on Space Technology, including through two Mars Missions in 2026 and 2028, and lunar surface exploration on future Artemis missions.     As we transition to and innovate on the technologies of the future, such as 6G, AI, quantum computing, and biotechnology, we also commit to exploring opportunities for enhanced partnerships in these critical industries that protect our data from adversaries that would exploit it.Invitation to Visit ItalyPresident Trump accepted Prime Minister Meloni’s invitation to pay an official visit to Italy in the very near future. There is also consideration to hold, on such occasion, a meeting between U.S. and Europe.",

      "content": "White House Announces Revolutionary Federal Procurement Overhaul\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tThe White House\n\n\nApril 16, 2025 \n\n\n\n\nWashington, D.C. – Today, President Trump announced a first-of-its-kind overhaul of Federal procurement policy in order to increase competition and efficiency while decreasing costs. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will conduct a sweeping review and rewrite of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).\nAs the world’s largest buyer, spending almost $1 trillion annually on procurement contracts, the Federal Government should be promoting agility, competition, and results. Instead, our procurement process, after decades of regulatory buildup, does the exact opposite. It benefits ineffective and entrenched vendors who can afford massive compliance costs at the expense of every other potential vendor.\nLed by OFPP, the FAR Council will rewrite the FAR in plain English, eliminate non-statutory and duplicative regulations, remove DEI and wokeness, and add buyer guides in place of burdensome and outdated requirements. The Federal Government will no longer procure useless and wasteful products like paper straws. It will focus on results above all else – the best products and services at the best cost.\nThe current FAR is over 2,000 pages long with nearly 3,000 complex and costly directives for potential vendors. These byzantine regulations have created a bureaucratic maze that stifle innovation, snuff out competition, and drive up costs.\nA transaction that takes days for a normal business takes months or years for the Federal Government, and costs much more. Buyers and vendors alike spend more time navigating this bureaucratic maze than on delivering the best products and value for the taxpayer. In one case, a mission-support contract was delayed nearly two years after a public comment triggered multiple cascading legal reviews and procedural challenges that resulted  in no real change to the acquisition strategy. Too often layered reviews and rigid compliance block progress and fail to meet the government’s needs.\nUnder President Trump’s leadership, those days are over. This long-overdue Revolutionary FAR Overhaul (RFO) will ensure a faster acquisition cycle, lower barriers to entry for small businesses, startups, and other new entrants, and eliminate wasteful bureaucratic bloat.\n“This RFO will reduce more than 40 years of bureaucratic buildup that will unleash our procurement system with generational change and results. We are Making America Great Again,” said OMB Senior Advisor Kevin Rhodes. To complement the RFO, a brand-new website will bring an unprecedented level of transparency to the procurement process, so that any member of industry or the general public can stay informed on regulatory updates, buyer guides, and the overall process.",

This week is a time of reflection for Christians to memorialize Jesus’ crucifixion—and to prepare their hearts, minds, and souls for His miraculous Resurrection from the dead.\nDuring this sacred week, we acknowledge that the glory of Easter Sunday cannot come without the sacrifice Jesus Christ made on the cross.  In His final hours on Earth, Christ willingly endured excruciating pain, torture, and execution on the cross out of a deep and abiding love for all His creation.  Through His suffering, we have redemption.  Through His death, we are forgiven of our sins.  Through His Resurrection, we have hope of eternal life.  On Easter morning, the stone is rolled away, the tomb is empty, and light prevails over darkness—signaling that death does not have the final word.\nThis Holy Week, my Administration renews its promise to defend the Christian faith in our schools, military, workplaces, hospitals, and halls of government.  We will never waver in safeguarding the right to religious liberty, upholding the dignity of life, and protecting God in our public square.\nAs we focus on Christ’s redeeming sacrifice, we look to His love, humility, and obedience—even in life’s most difficult and uncertain moments.  This week, we pray for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon our beloved Nation.  We pray that America will remain a beacon of faith, hope, and freedom for the entire world, and we pray to achieve a future that reflects the truth, beauty, and goodness of Christ’s eternal kingdom in Heaven.\nMay God bless you and your family during this special time of year and may He continue to bless the United States of America.",

The bill advanced with broad bipartisan support.\nIn an official statement shared with the House Energy and Commerce Committee and on social media, the First Lady said, “I remain dedicated to championing child well-being, ensuring that every young person can thrive and ‘Be Best.’ Thank you to the House Energy & Commerce Committee for advancing the Take It Down Act. This marks a significant step in our bipartisan efforts to safeguard our children from online threats. I urge Congress to swiftly pass this important legislation. Together, we can create a safer, brighter future for all Americans!”\nThe Take It Down Act would protect children who are targeted by the publication of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) online, require internet platforms—including social media platforms—to remove such imagery within 48 hours of notice from a victim, and provide justice for survivors by criminalizing the publication of, or threat to publish, NCII.Read the House Energy and Commerce Committee press release here or below.\n\nApril 8, 2025\nChairman Guthrie, First Lady Melania Trump, Chairman Bilirakis Join Advocates in Celebrating Committee Passage of TAKE IT DOWN Act\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brett Guthrie (KY-02), Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, along with advocates for the TAKE IT DOWN Act, issued the following statements of support after the bill was reported out of Committee by a vote of 49 to 1.\n“No man, woman, or child should be subjected to the spread of explicit AI images meant to target and harass innocent victims. I am so thankful for our outstanding advocates and legislators who have worked hard to raise awareness and build a strong coalition to support this bipartisan bill,” said Chairman Guthrie. “Today, the Committee on Energy and Commerce advanced the bill to the full House of Representatives, where I look forward to, once again, voting in favor of the TAKE IT DOWN Act, so that we can send it to the President’s desk for signature.”\n“I remain dedicated to championing child well-being, ensuring that every young person can thrive and ‘Be Best.’ Thank you to the House Energy & Commerce Committee for advancing the TAKE IT DOWN Act. This marks a significant step in our bipartisan efforts to safeguard our children from online threats,” said First Lady Melania Trump. “I urge Congress to swiftly pass this important legislation. Together, we can create a safer, brighter future for all Americans!”\n“I am glad we are one step closer to protecting victims of online sexual exploitation. Giving victims rights to flag non-consensual images and requiring social media companies to remove that content quickly is a pivotal and necessary change to the online landscape,” said Congressman Gus Bilirakis (FL-12), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade. “And by ensuring that AI-generated deep-fake content is included in these protections, Congress is showing its commitment to fighting 21st Century harms that are plaguing our children and grandchildren.”\n“In February, our family mourned the loss of our loving son and brother, Elijah Heacock, after he fell victim to an extortion scheme on the internet,” said Shannon Cronister-Heacock, mother of Elijah Heacock. “We are grateful for the support of Chairman Guthrie and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for passing the TAKE IT DOWN Act today to ensure that no parent, sibling, or loved one experiences a similar tragedy in the future. This bill honors Elijah’s life, and we are appreciative of Congress’ actions to protect children online and save lives.”\n“I was only fourteen years old when one of my classmates created deepfake, AI nudes of me and distributed them on social media. I was shocked, violated, and felt unsafe going to school. Thankfully, I was able to work with Senator Ted Cruz’s office to write the TAKE IT DOWN Act — and today is an important milestone towards that bill becoming law, so that no other girl has to go through what I went through without legal protections in place,” said Elliston Berry, survivor and advocate. “Thank you to Chairman Guthrie for prioritizing the TAKE IT DOWN Act for committee passage.”\n“At 14, for almost two years, I stood alone, advocating for AI deep fake laws to protect us after my school’s inaction and lack of accountability insulted my self-respect. This journey is dedicated to every woman and teenager who was told to stay silent and move on. It is also a testament to the courageous bipartisan leaders who stood beside me, proving that change is possible. Today, we celebrate a critical step towards the passage of the TAKE IT DOWN Act into federal law,” said Francesca Mani, AI victim turned advocate & TIME100 AI Most Influential Person. “A heartfelt thank you to Chairman Guthrie for standing with us and making swift committee passage possible. We are no longer alone.”\n“Today, we celebrate an important victory with House committee passage of the TAKE IT DOWN Act, a federal safeguard against non-consensual AI-generated intimate images,” said Dorota Mani, an educator, advocate, and mother. “This important legislation, which is now well on its way to the President’s desk, staunchly defends our women and children while preserving every American’s dignity and rights.” “Survivors—both minors and adults—deserve protection and justice. Every survivor should be able to report their abuse to law enforcement, have their abuse content removed fully and abusers should be found and held appropriately accountable. Image-based sexual abuse is sexual assault facilitated online. You cannot accidentally sexual assault someone offline and the same should be true for the online. The harms of all forms of image-based sexual abuse—including deepfake abuse—quickly follow that victim home, to school, to work and anywhere they try to exist after such a profound and public trauma,” said Andrea Powell, Co-Founder and Chief of Impact, Alecto AI. “Alecto AI supports the TAKE IT DOWN Act because we believe that in its passage, we will be getting closer to a world where young women and girls don’t have worry that being online means being targets of sexual violence. All survivors deserve protection and justice.”",

      "content": "CEA Chairman Steve Miran Hudson Institute Event Remarks\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tThe White House\n\n\nApril 7, 2025 \n\n\n\n\nToday I’d like to discuss the United States’ provision of what economists call “global public goods,” for the entire world.  First, the United States provides a security umbrella which has created the greatest era of peace mankind has ever known.  Second, the U.S. provides the dollar and Treasury securities, reserve assets which make possible the global trading and financial system which has supported the greatest era of prosperity mankind has ever known. \nBoth of these are costly to us to provide.  On the defense side, our men and women in uniform take heroic risks to make our nation and the world safer, preserving our liberties generation after generation.  And we tax hardworking Americans mightily to finance global security.  On the financial side, the reserve function of the dollar has caused persistent currency distortions and contributed, along with other countries’ unfair barriers to trade, to unsustainable trade deficits.  These trade deficits have decimated our manufacturing sector and many working-class families and their communities, to facilitate non-Americans trading with each other.\nLet me clarify that by “reserve currency,” I mean all the international functions of the dollar—private savings and trade included.  I’ve often used the example that when private agents in two separate foreign countries trade with each other, it’s typically denominated in dollars because of America’s status as the reserve provider.  That trade entails savings housed in dollar securities, often Treasurys.  As a result of all this, Americans have been paying for peace and prosperity not just for themselves, but for non-Americans too.\nPresident Trump has made it clear that he will no longer stand for other nations free-riding on our blood, sweat, and tears, whether in national security or trade.  The Trump Administration has already, in its first hundred days, moved forcefully to reorient our defense and trading relationships to place Americans on fairer ground.  The President has promised to rebuild our broken industrial base and pursue trade terms that put American workers and businesses first.\nI’m an economist and not a military strategist, so I’ll dwell more on trade than on defense, but the two are deeply connected.  To see how it works, imagine two foreign nations, say China and Brazil, trading with each other.  Neither country has a currency that is trusted, liquid, and convertible, which makes trading with each other challenging.  However, because they can transact in U.S. dollars backed by U.S. Treasuries, they are able to trade freely with each other and prosper.  Such trade can only occur because of U.S. military might ensuring our financial stability and the credibility of our borrowing.  Our military and financial dominance cannot be taken for granted; and the Trump Administration is determined to preserve them.\nBut our financial dominance comes at a cost.  While it is true that demand for dollars has kept our borrowing rates low, it has also kept currency markets distorted.  This process has placed undue burdens on our firms and workers, making their products and labor uncompetitive on the global stage, and forcing a decline of our manufacturing workforce by over a third since its peak1 and a reduction in our share of world manufacturing production of 40%.\nWe need to be able to make things in this country, as we saw during Covid, when many of our supply chains could not survive without being reliant on our biggest adversary, China.  We clearly should not rely on our biggest adversary for equipment essential to keeping our population safe and secure.  Nor should our biggest adversary be allowed to benefit so much from an international security and financial architecture we finance.\nThere are other unfortunate side effects of providing reserve assets.  Others may buy our assets to manipulate their own currency to keep their exports cheap.  In doing so, they end up pumping so much money into the U.S. economy that it fuels economic vulnerabilities and crises.  For example, in the years running up to the 2008 crash, China along with many foreign financial institutions, increased their holdings of U.S. mortgage debt, which helped fuel the housing bubble, forcing hundreds of billions of dollars of credit into the housing sector without regard as to whether the investments made sense.  China played a meaningful role creating the Global Financial Crisis.  It took almost a decade to recover, until President Trump got us back on track in his first term.\nIn my view, to continue providing these twin global public goods, there needs to be improved burden-sharing at the global level.  If other nations want to benefit from the U.S. geopolitical and financial umbrella, then they need to pull their weight, and pay their fair share.  The costs cannot be solely borne by everyday Americans who have already given so much.\nThe best outcome is one in which America continues to create global peace and prosperity and remain the reserve provider, and other countries not only participate in reaping the benefits, but they also participate in bearing the costs.  By improving burden sharing, we can enhance resilience, and preserve the global security and trading systems for many decades into the future.\nMoreover, it is critical not just for fairness, but for capacity.  We are under siege by hostile adversaries trying to erode our manufacturing and defense industrial base and disrupt our financial system; we will be able to provide neither defense nor reserve assets if our manufacturing capacity is hollowed out.  The President has been clear that the United States is committed to remaining the reserve provider, but that the system must be made fairer.  We need to rebuild our industries to project the strength needed to protect reserve status, and we need to be able to pay our bills to do so.\nWhat forms can that burden sharing take?  There are many options, here are a few ideas:\n\nFirst, other countries can accept tariffs on their exports to the United States without retaliation, providing revenue to the U.S. Treasury to finance public goods provision.  Critically, retaliation will exacerbate rather than improve the distribution of burdens and make it even more difficult for us to finance global public goods.\nSecond, they can stop unfair and harmful trading practices by opening their markets and buying more from America;\nThird, they can boost defense spending and procurement from the U.S., buying more U.S.-made goods, and taking strain off our servicemembers and creating jobs here;\nFourth, they can invest in and install factories in America.  They won’t face tariffs if they make their stuff in this country;\nFifth, they could simply write checks to Treasury that help us finance global public goods.\n\nTariffs deserve some extra attention.  Most economists and some investors dismiss tariffs as counterproductive at best and devastatingly harmful at worst.  They’re wrong. \nOne reason the economic consensus on tariffs is so wrong is because nearly all of the models that economists use to study international trade assume either no trade deficits at all, or assume that deficits are short-lived and quickly self-correct through currency adjustments.  According to standard models, trade deficits will cause the dollar to weaken, which reduces imports and boosts exports, eventually wiping out the trade deficit.  If that happens, tariffs may be unnecessary, because trade will balance itself over time and, in this view, intervening with tariffs can only make things worse.\nHowever, that view is at odds with reality.  The United States has run current account deficits now for five decades, and these have widened precipitously in recent years, going from about 2% of GDP in the first Trump Administration to a high of nearly 4% of GDP in the Biden Administration2.  And this has happened all while the dollar has appreciated, not depreciated!\nThe long run is here, and the models are wrong.  One reason is that they fail to account for the U.S. provision of the global reserve currency.  Reserve status matters and, because demand for the dollar has been insatiable, it has been too strong for international flows to balance, even over five decades.\nMore recent economic analyses3 allow for the possibility of persistent trade deficits that resist automatically rebalancing, which is more in line with reality in the U.S.  They show that by imposing tariffs against exporting countries, the U.S. can improve economic outcomes, raise revenues, and impose huge losses for the tariffed nation, even with full retaliation.\nIn this sense, analysis of what economists call the “incidence” of tariffs indicates that a large share and burden of the tariffs are “paid for” by the country on which we’re applying the tariffs.  Countries that run large trade surpluses are pretty inflexible—they can’t find other sources of demand to substitute for America’s.  Instead, they have no choice but to export, and America is the largest consumer market in the world.  By contrast, America has plenty of substitution options: we can make stuff at home, or we can buy from countries that treat us fairly instead of from countries that take advantage of us.  This difference in leverage means that other countries end up bearing the cost of tariffs.\nIn 2018-2019, China bore the cost of President Trump’s historic tariffs through a weaker currency, meaning their citizens became poorer, with less purchasing power on the global stage.  The tariff revenue, paid for by China, was used to finance President Trump’s tax cuts for American workers and firms.  This time around, tariffs will help pay for both tax cuts and deficit reduction.\nLower taxes on Americans, financed in part by revenue provided from foreigners, will create economic growth, dynamism, and opportunity the likes of which our country has never seen, ushering in President Trump’s new Golden Age.  Deficit reduction will help lower Treasury rates, and with them mortgage rates and consumer credit card rates, stimulating an economic boom.\nIt is important to note here that tariffs are not levied simply to collect revenues.  For example, the President’s reciprocal tariffs are designed to address tariff and non-tariff barriers and other forms of cheating like currency manipulation, dumping, and subsidies to gain unfair advantage.  Revenue is a nice side effect, and if it is used in part for lowering taxes, it can help turbo-charge competitiveness improvements that boost U.S. exports.\nBurden sharing can allow the United States to continue leading the free world for many decades.  It’s a must not only for fairness, but for feasibility.  If we don’t rebuild our manufacturing sector, we will be strained in providing the security we need for our safety and to underpin our financial markets.  The world can still have the American defense umbrella and trading system, but it’s got to start paying its fair share for them.  Thank you, and I am happy to take some questions.\n\n[1] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP\n[2]

A new sapling, which is a direct descendant of the “Jackson Magnolia,” will be planted in its place on Tuesday, April 8, 2025.\n“After expert analysis and careful coordination between Peter Hart, a board-certified Master Arborist and registered consulting arborist with the American Society of Consulting Arborists, National Park Service, the White House Grounds Superintendent, the White House Executive Residence and its Office of the Curator, the Offices of the President and the First Lady, and United States Secret Service, the White House has made the careful decision to remove the Jackson Magnolia to ensure the safety of staff, visitors, and the Grounds themselves,” said a White House spokesperson. “Remnants of the old tree will be preserved by the Office of the Curator and honored by the White House, and this new tree will continue the heritage of the ‘Jackson Magnolia’ for generations to come.”\nThe collaborative decision regarding the “Jackson Magnolia” follows a comprehensive assessment by Peter Hart, a board-certified master arborist and registered consulting arborist with the American Society of Consulting Arborists, which concluded the tree has “surpassed the time of serving as an aesthetic and historic landmark due to the potential harm it may cause because of the risk of structural failure.” The report also recommended, “to eliminate the risk of personal injury and/or property damage, this tree should be removed as soon as can be scheduled.”\nThe National Park Service provided the following in concurrence with the report, “Despite ongoing preservation efforts, the ‘Jackson Magnolia’ tree has reached the end of its lifespan and must be removed due to safety concerns. The average lifespan of a Southern Magnolia is 100 years. A new magnolia sapling from the original tree will continue the tradition of honoring this tree’s history while investing in the future. Together with the Executive Residence staff, the National Park Service remains committed to caring for the White House landscape and grounds, ensuring its legacy endures for this and future generations.”\nBACKGROUNDPreservation: Existing procedures and cooperation between the National Park Service (NPS), White House Executive Residence, and its Office of the Curator, will ensure the preservation of the salvageable remnants of the “Jackson Magnolia.”\nPer NPS: As the White House Grounds are a part of the National Park system in accordance with applicable NPS regulations and policy and General Services Administration rules on disposal of excess government property, the NPS will—after setting aside a sample of the tree for historical and archival purposes—transfer any remaining wood from the Jackson Magnolia to the Executive Residence, which is a Federal component within the Executive Office of the President.\nThe White House remains committed to the stewardship and preservation of its historic grounds and will continue to work closely with professionals in maintaining the safety, beauty, and historical integrity of the property.\n\n\nNew Sapling: The new sapling is 12 years old and was grown at the offsite National Park Service Greenhouse in preparation for the removal of its parent, the “Jackson Magnolia.”\n\n\nJackson Magnolia: The “Jackson Magnolia” is a Southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), which is located on the South Grounds of the White House, on the west side of the South Portico. It is considered one of the oldest trees on the White House complex, which, according to oral history, traces its roots back to the era of President Andrew Jackson. Over the years, it has been carefully maintained, including the addition of structural support efforts, but its condition has declined beyond recovery.

Roosevelt wrote a letter like this one to his science and technology advisor, Vannevar Bush, charging him to explore new frontiers of the mind for the sake of national greatness and pioneer science in peacetime.  Dr. Bush’s response laid the groundwork for the uniquely successful American partnership of Government, industry, and academia that built the greatest and most productive nation in human history.\nBut today, rivals abroad seek to usurp America’s position as the world’s greatest maker of marvels and producer of knowledge.  We must recapture the urgency which propelled us so far in the last century.  The time has come to return to our roots and renew the American scientific enterprise for the century ahead.  So, just as FDR tasked Vannevar Bush, I am tasking you with meeting the challenges below to deliver for the American people.\nFirst:  How can the United States secure its position as the unrivaled world leader in critical and emerging technologies — such as artificial intelligence, quantum information science, and nuclear technology — maintaining our advantage over potential adversaries?\nWe need to accelerate research and development, dismantle regulatory barriers, strengthen domestic supply chains and manufacturing, spur robust private sector investment, and advance American companies in global markets.  Rival nations are pushing hard to overtake the United States, and we must blaze a bold path to maintain our technological supremacy.\nSecond:  How can we revitalize America’s science and technology enterprise — pursuing truth, reducing administrative burdens, and empowering researchers to achieve groundbreaking discoveries?\nWe need new paradigms for the research enterprise, including innovative models for funding and sharing scientific research, redefining how America conducts the business of discovery.  We must build an ecosystem that attracts top talent, celebrates merit, protects our intellectual edge, and enables scientists to focus on meaningful work rather than administrative box checking.  \nThird:  How can we ensure that scientific progress and technological innovation fuel economic growth and better the lives of all Americans?\nDuring my first term, we made unprecedented advances in America’s scientific and technological leadership.  We launched the American Artificial Intelligence Initiative, vaulting the United States to the front of the pack in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence.  Our National Quantum Initiative established the foundation for national quantum supremacy.  We created the United States Space Force and charted a new and daring course for America’s further exploration of space.  All of this buttressed our security and bolstered our prosperity, and it reaffirmed America’s place as the world’s preeminent technological superpower.\nNow, after 4 long years of weakness and complacency, we must set our sights even higher.  I am calling upon you to blaze a trail to the next frontiers of science.  We have the opportunity to cement America’s global technological leadership and usher in the Golden Age of American Innovation.  We are not just competing with other nations; we are seeking, striving, fighting to make America greater than ever before.\nSincerely,\nDonald J. Trump",

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 23, 2025, as a day in celebration of the 250th anniversary of Patrick Henry’s speech to the Second Virginia Convention.\n     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this\ntwentieth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.\nDONALD J.

Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a fantastic phone conversation.  President Zelenskyy thanked President Trump for a productive start for the work of the Ukrainian and American teams in Jeddah on March 11th. The meeting of the senior officials from both nations significantly helped in moving toward ending the war.  \nPresident Zelenskyy thanked President Trump for the support of the United States, especially the Javelin missiles that President Trump was first to provide, and his efforts towards peace. The leaders agreed Ukraine and America will continue working together to bring about a real end to the war, and that lasting peace under President Trump’s leadership can be achieved. \nPresident Trump fully briefed President Zelenskyy on his conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the key issues discussed. They reviewed the situation in Kursk and agreed to share information closely between their defense staffs as the battlefield situation evolved.  President Zelenskyy asked for additional air defense systems to protect his civilians, particularly Patriot missile systems, President Trump agreed to work with him to find what was available particularly in Europe.\nThe two leaders also agreed on a partial ceasefire against energy. Technical teams will meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to discuss broadening the ceasefire to the Black Sea on the way to a full ceasefire. They agreed this could be the first step toward the full end of the war and ensuring security. President Zelenskyy was grateful for the President’s leadership in this effort and reiterated his willingness to adopt a full ceasefire.\nPresident Trump also discussed Ukraine’s electrical supply and nuclear power plants.  He said that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise.  American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.\nPresident Zelenskyy also thanked President Trump for continuing to push humanitarian concerns, including the exchange of POWs.  He noted they had just had a successful exchange and thanked the President for his leadership.  President Trump also asked President Zelenskyy about the children who had gone missing from Ukraine during the war, including the ones that had been abducted.  President Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home.  \nThey agreed all parties must continue the effort to make a ceasefire work. The Presidents noted the positive work of their advisors and representatives, especially Secretary Rubio, National Security Advisor Waltz, Special Envoy Kellogg, and others.  The Presidents instructed their teams to move ahead with the technical issues related to implementing and broadening the partial ceasefire. The Presidents instructed their advisors and representatives to carry out this work as quickly as possible. The Presidents emphasized that in further meetings, the teams can agree on all necessary aspects of advancing toward lasting peace and security.”",

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 16, 2025, through March 22, 2025, to be National Poison Prevention Week.  I call upon all Americans to observe this week by taking actions to safeguard their families from poisonous products, chemicals, medicines, and drugs found in their homes, and to raise awareness about these dangers in order to prevent accidental injuries and deaths.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.\nDONALD J.

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2025 as Irish-American Heritage Month.  I call upon all Americans to celebrate the achievements of Irish Americans and their contributions to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth. \nDONALD J. TRUMP",

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2025 as Women’s History Month.  I call on all Americans to celebrate the exceptional women in their lives and around our country.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand thissixth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.\nDONALD J.

On this, the 255th Anniversary of the Boston Massacre, we pay tribute to and honor those who have paid the ultimate price in defense of America’s cherished values.",

This toxic environment can be severely damaging. We must prioritize their well-being by equipping them with the support and tools necessary to navigate this hostile digital landscape. Every young person deserves a safe online space to express themself freely, without the looming threat of exploitation or harm,” said First Lady Melania Trump.\nFollowing Mrs. Trump’s remarks, Members of Congress spoke and multiple survivors of NCII and advocates for online safety shared their personal stories. They joined in calling for the passage of the Take It Down Act. The Discussion addressed online protection, child well-being, and how artificial intelligence is changing the social media landscape.\nSenator Ted Cruz, commented: “For victims of revenge or AI-generated explicit imagery, life can change instantly and permanently. Everyone has the right to have these disturbing images removed from the internet immediately. The bipartisan Take It Down Act empowers victims across the United States, and I am honored that First Lady Melania Trump has lent her strong voice to this cause. Her presence and advocacy are driving real action for teens and children, and her support will be crucial in advancing this bill. I am encouraged by my House colleagues who joined us today, united in their commitment to take swift action. Following the Senate’s unanimous approval, the House must act quickly to send this legislation to President Trump’s desk before more victims are left without recourse.”\nTake It Down Act Advocate, Francesca Mani, said: “A strong Federal law is crucial – one that shifts power back to the victims, ensuring they can remove harmful images within 48 hours. That’s not just policy – that’s real, tangible protection. That’s Take it Down.” \nTake It Down Act Advocate, Elliston Berry, said: “This bipartisan bill is meant to protect American children. Thank you to the First Lady and House leadership for understanding how important this issue is and taking time to learn about this vital piece of legislation. I share my story to give victims a voice they never had and change this horrible situation into something good.”\n###",

Anthony, a warrior for women and hero of Equality, Justice, and the Constitutional rule of law.\nFor her entire life, Susan B. Anthony was fiercely devoted to the principle that every American, regardless of race or sex, is born with the God-given right to enjoy the blessings of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. Years later, her fearless crusade for Equality culminated in the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution, which blocked states from denying citizens the right to vote on the basis of sex. Throughout her storied life, she also emerged as a champion of the abolitionist movement and a tireless advocate for the sanctity of life.\nAs President, I have already taken historic action to advance the sacred causes that Susan B. Anthony cherished so deeply. I was honored to sign an Executive Order safeguarding women’s sports—ensuring the survival of free and competitive spaces for female athletes. Additionally, I was proud to order the end of taxpayer-funded abortion—a big win for the most vulnerable among us.\nWhile my Administration continues to honor the legacy of Susan B. Anthony and promote our shared cause of Liberty and Justice for all, I also want to thank our Nation’s First Lady, Melania Trump, for previously hosting a White House celebration with America’s youth to honor the centennial anniversary of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. I know she looks forward to continuing to help empower and support girls and women in the United States and around the globe.\nToday, Melania joins me in paying tribute to Susan B. Anthony’s perseverance, leadership, and monumental achievements. Let us continue her life’s work of creating a culture that celebrates the enduring triumph of Freedom, the dignity of life, and the full glory of the American promise.",

      "content": "United States-India Joint Leaders’ Statement \n\n\n\n\tThe White House\n\n\nFebruary 13, 2025 \n\n\n\n\nThe President of the United States of America, The Honorable Donald J. Trump hosted the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi for an Official Working Visit in Washington, DC on February 13, 2025.  As the leaders of sovereign and vibrant democracies that value freedom, the rule of law, human rights, and pluralism, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi reaffirmed the strength of the India-U.S. Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership, anchored in mutual trust, shared interests, goodwill and robust engagement of their citizens. Today, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi launched a new initiative – the “U.S.-India COMPACT (Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce & Technology) for the 21st Century” – to drive transformative change across key pillars of cooperation. Under this initiative, they committed to a results-driven agenda with initial outcomes this year to demonstrate the level of trust for a mutually beneficial partnership.    Defense 1.    Highlighting the deepening convergence of U.S.-India strategic interests, the leaders reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to a dynamic defense partnership spanning multiple domains. To advance defense ties further, the leaders announced plans to sign this year a new ten-year Framework for the U.S.-India Major Defense Partnership in the 21st Century. 2.    The leaders welcomed the significant integration of U.S.-origin defense items into India’s inventory to date, including C‑130J Super Hercules, C‑17 Globemaster III, P‑8I Poseidon aircraft; CH‑47F Chinooks, MH‑60R Seahawks, and AH‑64E Apaches; Harpoon anti-ship missiles; M777 howitzers; and MQ‑9Bs.  The leaders determined that the U.S. would expand defense sales and co-production with India to strengthen interoperability and defense industrial cooperation.  They announced plans to pursue this year new procurements and co-production arrangements for “Javelin” Anti-Tank Guided Missiles and “Stryker” Infantry Combat Vehicles in India to rapidly meet India’s defense requirements. They also expect completion of procurement for six additional P-8I Maritime Patrol aircraft to enhance India’s maritime surveillance reach in the Indian Ocean Region following agreement on sale terms. 3.    Recognizing that India is a Major Defense Partner with Strategic Trade Authorization-1 (STA‑1) authorization and a key Quad partner, the U.S. and India will review their respective arms transfer regulations, including International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), in order to streamline defense trade, technology exchange and maintenance, spare supplies and in-country repair and overhaul of U.S.-provided defense systems. The leaders also called for opening negotiations this year for a Reciprocal Defense Procurement (RDP) agreement to better align their procurement systems and enable the reciprocal supply of defense goods and services. The leaders pledged to accelerate defense technology cooperation across space, air defense, missile, maritime and undersea technologies, with the U.S. announcing a review of its policy on releasing fifth generation fighters and undersea systems to India. 4.    Building on the U.S.-India Roadmap for Defense Industrial Cooperation and recognizing the rising importance of autonomous systems, the leaders announced a new initiative – the Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance (ASIA) – to scale industry partnerships and production in the Indo-Pacific.  The leaders welcomed a new partnership between Anduril Industries and Mahindra Group on advanced autonomous technologies to co-develop and co-produce state-of-the-art maritime systems and advanced AI-enabled counter Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to strengthen regional security, and between L3 Harris and Bharat Electronics for co-development of active towed array systems. 5.    The leaders also pledged to elevate military cooperation across all domains – air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace – through enhanced training, exercises, and operations, incorporating the latest technologies.  The leaders welcomed the forthcoming “Tiger Triumph” tri-service exercise (first inaugurated in 2019) with larger scale and complexity to be hosted in India. 6.    Finally, the leaders committed to break new ground to support and sustain the overseas deployments of the U.S. and Indian militaries in the Indo-Pacific, including enhanced logistics and intelligence sharing, as well as arrangements to improve force mobility for joint humanitarian and disaster relief operations along with other exchanges and security cooperation engagements.Trade and Investment7.    The leaders resolved to expand trade and investment to make their citizens more prosperous, nations stronger, economies more innovative and supply chains more resilient.  They resolved to deepen the U.S.-India trade relationship to promote growth that ensures fairness, national security and job creation.  To this end, the leaders set a bold new goal for bilateral trade – “Mission 500” – aiming to more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.  8.    Recognizing that this level of ambition would require new, fair-trade terms, the leaders announced plans to negotiate the first tranche of a mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) by fall of 2025. The leaders committed to designate senior representatives to advance these negotiations and to ensure that the trade relationship fully reflects the aspirations of the COMPACT. To advance this innovative, wide-ranging BTA, the U.S. and India will take an integrated approach to strengthen and deepen bilateral trade across the goods and services sector, and will work towards increasing market access, reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepening supply chain integration. 9.    The leaders welcomed early steps to demonstrate mutual commitment to address bilateral trade barriers. The United States welcomed India’s recent measures to lower tariffs on U.S. products of interest in the areas of bourbon, motorcycles, ICT products and metals, as well as measures to enhance market access for U.S. agricultural products, like alfalfa hay and duck meat, and medical devices.  India also expressed appreciation for U.S. measures taken to enhance exports of Indian mangoes and pomegranates to the United States.  Both sides also pledged to collaborate to enhance bilateral trade by increasing U.S. exports of industrial goods to India and Indian exports of labor-intensive manufactured products to the United States. The two sides will also work together to increase trade in agricultural goods.10.    Finally, the leaders committed to drive opportunities for U.S. and Indian companies to make greenfield investments in high-value industries in each other’s countries.  In this regard, the leaders welcomed ongoing investments by Indian companies worth approximately $7.35 billion, such as those by Hindalco’s Novelis in finished aluminum goods at their state-of-the art facilities in Alabama and Kentucky; JSW in steel manufacturing operations at Texas and Ohio; Epsilon Advanced Materials in the manufacture of critical battery materials in North Carolina; and Jubilant Pharma in the manufacture of injectables in Washington. These investments support over 3,000 high-quality jobs for local families. Energy Security11.    The leaders agreed that energy security is fundamental to economic growth, social well-being and technical innovation in both countries. They underscored the importance of U.S.-India collaboration to ensure energy affordability, reliability, and availability and stable energy markets. Realizing the consequential role of the U.S. and India, as leading producers and consumers, in driving the global energy landscape, the leaders re-committed to the U.S.-India Energy Security Partnership, including in oil, gas, and civil nuclear energy. 12.    The leaders underscored the importance of enhancing the production of hydrocarbons to ensure better global energy prices and secure affordable and reliable energy access for their citizens. The leaders also underscored the value of strategic petroleum reserves to preserve economic stability during crises and resolved to work with key partners to expand strategic oil reserve arrangements.  In this context, the U.S. side affirmed its firm support for India to join the International Energy Agency as a full member. 13.    The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to increase energy trade, as part of efforts to ensure energy security, and to establish the United States as a leading supplier of crude oil and petroleum products and liquified natural gas to India, in line with the growing needs and priorities of our dynamic economies. They underscored the tremendous scope and opportunity to increase trade in the hydrocarbon sector including natural gas, ethane and petroleum products as part of efforts to ensure supply diversification and energy security. The leaders committed to enhance investments, particularly in oil and gas infrastructure, and facilitate greater cooperation between the energy companies of the two countries. 14.    The leaders announced their commitment to fully realize the U.S.-India 123 Civil Nuclear Agreement by moving forward with plans to work together to build U.S.-designed nuclear reactors in India through large scale localization and possible technology transfer. Both sides welcomed the recent Budget announcement by Government of India to take up amendments to the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA) for nuclear reactors and further decided to establish bilateral arrangements in accordance with CLNDA, that would address the issue of civil liability and facilitate the collaboration of Indian and U.S. industry in the production and deployment of nuclear reactors. This path forward will unlock plans to build large U.S.-designed reactors and enable collaboration to develop, deploy and scale up nuclear power generation with advanced small modular reactors. Technology and Innovation15.    The leaders announced the launch of the U.S.-India TRUST (“Transforming the Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technology”) initiative, which will catalyze government-to-government, academia and private sector collaboration to promote application of critical and emerging technologies in areas like defense, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum, biotechnology, energy and space, while encouraging the use of verified technology vendors and ensuring sensitive technologies are protected. 16.    As a central pillar of the “TRUST” initiative, the leaders committed to work with U.S. and Indian private industry to put forward a U.S.-India Roadmap on Accelerating AI Infrastructure by the end of the year, identifying constraints to financing, building, powering, and connecting large-scale U.S.-origin AI infrastructure in India with milestones and future actions.  The U.S. and India will work together to enable industry partnerships and investments in next generation data centers, cooperation on development and access to compute and processors for AI, for innovations in AI models and building AI applications for solving societal challenges while addressing the protections and controls necessary to protect these technologies and reduce regulatory barriers.17.    The leaders announced the launch of INDUS Innovation, a new innovation bridge modeled after the successful INDUS-X platform, that will advance U.S.-India industry and academic partnerships and foster investments in space, energy, and other emerging technologies to maintain U.S. and India leadership in innovation and to meet the needs of the 21st century.  The leaders also reinforced their commitment to the INDUS-X initiative, which facilities partnerships between U.S. and Indian defense companies, investors and universities to produce critical capability for our militaries and welcomed the next summit in 2025.  18.    The leaders also committed, as part of the TRUST initiative, to build trusted and resilient supply chains, including for semiconductors, critical minerals, advanced materials and pharmaceuticals. As part of this effort, the leaders plan to encourage public and private investments to expand Indian manufacturing capacity, including in the U.S., for active pharmaceutical ingredients for critical medicines. These investments will create good jobs, diversify vital supply chains, and reduce the risk of life-saving drug shortages in both the United States and India.19.    Recognizing the strategic importance of critical minerals for emerging technologies and advanced manufacturing, India and the United States will accelerate collaboration in research and development and promote investment across the entire critical mineral value chain, as well as through the Mineral Security Partnership, of which both the United States and India are members. Both countries have committed to intensifying efforts to deepen cooperation in the exploration, beneficiation, and processing as well as recycling technologies of critical minerals. To this end, the leaders announced the launch of the Strategic Mineral Recovery initiative, a new U.S.-India program to recover and process critical minerals (including lithium, cobalt, and rare earths) from heavy industries like aluminum, coal mining and oil and gas.20.    The leaders hailed 2025 as a pioneering year for U.S.-India civil space cooperation, with plans for a NASA-ISRO effort through AXIOM to bring the first Indian astronaut to the International Space Station (ISS), and early launch of the joint “NISAR” mission, the first of its kind to systematically map changes to the Earth’s surface using dual radars.  The leaders called for more collaboration in space exploration, including on long duration human spaceflight missions, spaceflight safety and sharing of expertise and professional exchanges in emerging areas, including planetary protection. The leaders committed to further commercial space collaboration through industry engagements in conventional and emerging areas, such as connectivity, advanced spaceflight, satellite and space launch systems, space sustainability, space tourism and advanced space manufacturing. 21.    The leaders underscored the value of deepening ties between the U.S. and Indian scientific research communities, announcing a new partnership between the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Indian Anusandhan National Research Foundation in researching critical and emerging technologies.  This partnership builds on ongoing collaboration between the U.S. National Science Foundation and several Indian science agencies to enable joint research in the areas of semiconductors, connected vehicles, machine learning, next-generation telecommunications, intelligent transportation systems, and future biomanufacturing. 22.    The leaders determined that their governments redouble efforts to address export controls, enhance high technology commerce, and reduce barriers to technology transfer between our two countries, while addressing technology security.  The leaders also resolved to work together to counter the common challenge of unfair practices in export controls by third parties seeking to exploit overconcentration of critical supply chains.  Multilateral Cooperation23.    The leaders reaffirmed that a close partnership between the U.S. and India is central to a free, open, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. As Quad partners, the leaders reiterated that this partnership is underpinned by the recognition of ASEAN centrality; adherence to international law and good governance; support for safety and freedom of navigation, overflight and other lawful uses of the seas; and unimpeded lawful commerce; and advocacy for peaceful resolution of maritime disputes in accordance with international law. 24.    Prime Minister Modi looks forward to hosting President Trump in New Delhi for the Quad leaders’ Summit, ahead of which the leaders will activate new Quad initiatives on shared airlift capacity to support civilian response to natural disasters and maritime patrols to improve interoperability.   25.    The leaders resolved to increase cooperation, enhance diplomatic consultations, and increase tangible collaboration with partners in the Middle East. They highlighted the importance of investing in critical infrastructure and economic corridors to advancing peace and security in the region.  The leaders plan to convene partners from the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor and the I2U2 Group within the next six months in order to announce new initiatives in 2025.  26.    The US appreciates India’s role as a developmental, humanitarian assistance and net security provider in the Indian Ocean Region. In this context, the leaders committed to deepen bilateral dialogue and cooperation across the vast Indian Ocean region and launched the Indian Ocean Strategic Venture, a new bilateral, whole-of-government forum to advance coordinated investments in economic connectivity and commerce. Supporting greater Indian Ocean connectivity, the leaders also welcomed Meta’s announcement of a multi-billion, multi-year investment in an undersea cable project that will begin work this year and ultimately stretch over 50,000 km to connect five continents and strengthen global digital highways in the Indian Ocean region and beyond. India intends to invest in maintenance, repair and financing of undersea cables in the Indian Ocean, using trusted vendors. 27.    The leaders recognized the need to build new plurilateral anchor partnerships in the Western Indian Ocean, Middle East, and Indo-Pacific to grow relationships, commerce and cooperation across defense, technology, energy and critical minerals.  The leaders expect to announce new partnership initiatives across these sub-regions by fall of 2025. 28.    The leaders also resolved to advance military cooperation in multinational settings to advance global peace and security. The leaders applauded India’s decision to take on a future leadership role in the Combined Maritime Forces naval task force to help secure sea lanes in the Arabian Sea.29.    The leaders reaffirmed that the global scourge of terrorism must be fought, and terrorist safe havens eliminated from every corner of the world.  They committed to strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from groups, including Al-Qa’ida, ISIS, Jaish-e-Mohammad, and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in order to prevent heinous acts like the attacks in Mumbai on 26/11 and the Abbey Gate bombing in Afghanistan on August 26, 2021.  Recognizing a shared desire to bring to justice those who would harm our citizens, the U.S. announced that the extradition to India of Tahawwur Rana has been approved.

      "content": "United States-Japan Joint Leaders’ Statement\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tThe White House\n\n\nFebruary 7, 2025 \n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru held their first official meeting today in Washington, D.C., where they affirmed their determination to pursue a new golden age for U.S.-Japan relations that upholds a free and open Indo-Pacific and brings peace and prosperity to a violent and disorderly world.  U.S.-Japan Cooperation for Peace The two leaders expressed their shared desire for bilateral security and defense cooperation under the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security to grow stronger than ever, and emphasized that the U.S.-Japan Alliance remains the cornerstone of peace, security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Japan reiterated its unwavering commitment to fundamentally reinforce its own defense capabilities, which the United States welcomed. The United States underscored its unwavering commitment to the defense of Japan, using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. The two leaders reaffirmed that Article V of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security applies to the Senkaku Islands, and reiterated their strong opposition to any action that seeks to undermine Japan’s longstanding and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands. In line with the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and the U.S.-Japan Guidelines for Defense Cooperation, Japan reaffirmed its role in maintaining peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region by seamlessly responding to any situation from peacetime to contingencies. This has been further enabled by Japan’s 2015 Legislation for Peace and Security, which enhances U.S.-Japan Alliance deterrence and response capabilities. In order to address an increasingly severe and complex security environment, the two leaders confirmed that they intend to further strengthen U.S.-Japan deterrence and response capabilities by enhancing defense and security cooperation, including by upgrading the respective command and control frameworks of U.S. and Japanese forces, increasing bilateral presence in Japan’s Southwest Islands, increasing readiness through more realistic training and exercises, further enhancing U.S. extended deterrence, and promoting defense equipment and technology cooperation, including co-production, co-development, and co-sustainment that bolsters allied supply chains and strengthens U.S. and Japanese defense industrial capacity, including maritime. The United States and Japan intend to continue their strong partnership in civil space and on aeronautics, science, and human exploration, including on the upcoming Crew-10 mission to the International Space Station that includes U.S. and Japanese astronauts as well as lunar surface exploration on future Artemis missions. The United States and Japan also intend to expand bilateral security cooperation in cyberspace by leveraging new technologies such as artificial intelligence and secure and resilient cloud services to deepen information-sharing. The United States welcomed Japan’s commitment, underpinned by a favorable trend of its defense budget increase, to building capabilities by FY 2027 to consolidate its primary responsibility for defending Japan, and, building on this significant foundation, to fundamentally reinforcing its defense capabilities beyond FY 2027.   In order to maintain deterrence and mitigate the impact on local communities, the two leaders confirmed the vital importance of the steady implementation of the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan in accordance with the Okinawa Consolidation Plan, including the construction of the Futenma Replacement Facility at Henoko and the return of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma.   The two leaders instructed their foreign and defense ministers to convene a Security Consultative Committee (SCC: “2+2”) meeting at an early date to implement the above-mentioned cooperation in an expeditious manner. U.S.-Japan Cooperation for Growth and Prosperity The two leaders affirmed that bilateral economic cooperation, including on economic security, forms an indispensable part of Alliance cooperation. As close economic partners, the United States and Japan provide the largest amount of foreign direct investment and create high quality jobs in each other’s countries. Industries of both countries continue to play a vital role for each other’s supply chains.To chart an unwavering course for strengthening economic ties and elevating the economic partnership to the next level, the two leaders will seek to: promote business opportunities and significantly increase bilateral investment and employment; strengthen their industrial bases and collaborate to lead the world in developing critical technologies such as AI, quantum computing, and leading-edge semiconductors; enhance efforts to counter and build resilience against economic coercion; and jointly promote growth in the Indo-Pacific region underpinned by a free and fair economic order. They also resolved to continue discussions on aligning policies to further promote and protect critical and sensitive technologies, including through export controls, and to enhance supply chain resilience. With a shared commitment to the integrity of travel systems that underpin economic prosperity, they intend to strengthen efforts to vet travelers and routinely and securely share information to combat technology theft, travel by criminals, and illegal immigration. The two leaders announced their intention to strengthen energy security by unleashing the United States’ affordable and reliable energy and natural resources, and by increasing exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Japan in a mutually beneficial manner. They also welcomed efforts to diversify critical minerals supply chains and to collaborate on developing and deploying cutting-edge small modular reactor and other advanced nuclear reactor technology. The two leaders instructed their relevant ministers in charge to strengthen U.S.-Japan economic cooperation to achieve these shared goals. U.S.-Japan Coordination in the Indo-Pacific The two leaders shared views on the severe and complex security environment and expressed their determination to continuously cooperate to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific. As part of such cooperation, the two leaders intend to advance multilayered and aligned cooperation among like-minded countries, including Japan-Australia-India-U.S. (Quad), Japan-U.S.-Republic of Korea (ROK), Japan-U.S.-Australia, and Japan-U.S.-Philippines. Through these relationships, the United States, Japan, and like-minded partners can deliver high quality infrastructure investments in the region, including the deployment of Open Radio Access Networks in third countries. The two leaders reiterated their strong opposition to any attempts by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to change the status quo by force or coercion in the East China Sea. The two leaders reaffirmed their strong opposition to the PRC’s unlawful maritime claims, militarization of reclaimed features, and threatening and provocative activities in the South China Sea. The two leaders emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity for the international community. They encouraged the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues, and opposed any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion. The two leaders also expressed support for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in international organizations. The two leaders expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK’s) nuclear and missile programs and reaffirmed their resolute commitment to the complete denuclearization of the DPRK. Both countries underscored the need to deter and counter the DPRK’s malicious cyber activities and the DPRK’s increasing military cooperation with Russia. In addition, both countries affirmed the importance of the Japan-U.S.-ROK trilateral partnership in responding to the DPRK and upholding regional peace and prosperity. Japan reiterated its determination to achieve an immediate resolution of the abductions issue, which the United States supported.  Invitation to Visit Japan President Trump accepted an invitation from Prime Minister Ishiba for an official visit to Japan in the near future.",

LEAVITT:  Good afternoon, everybody. \nQ    Good afternoon.\nMS. LEAVITT:  How are we?  Good to see all of you.  It’s an honor to be here with all of you.  A lot of familiar faces in the room, a lot of new faces.\nAnd President Trump is back, and the golden age of America has most definitely begun. \nThe Senate has already confirmed five of President Trump’s exceptional Cabinet nominees: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.  It is imperative that the Senate continues to confirm the remainder of the president’s well-qualified nominees as quickly as possible.\nAs you have seen during the past week, President Trump is hard at work fulfilling the promises that he made to the American people on the campaign trail.  Since taking the oath of office, President Trump has taken more than 300 executive actions; secured nearly $1 trillion in U.S. investments; deported illegal alien rapists, gang members, and suspected terrorists from our homeland; and restored common sense to the federal government.\nI want to take a moment to go through some of these extraordinary actions. \nOn day one, President Trump declared a national emergency at our southern border to end the four-year-long invasion of illegal aliens under the previous administration.  Additionally, President Trump signed an executive order to end catch and release and finish construction of his effective border wall.  By using every lever of his federal power, President Trump has sent a loud and clear message to the entire world: America will no longer tolerate illegal immigration. \nAnd this president expects that every nation on this planet will cooperate with the repatriation of their citizens, as proven by this weekend, when President Trump swiftly directed his team to issue harsh and effective sanctions and tariffs on the Colombian government upon hearing they were denied a U.S. military aircraft full of their own citizens who were deported by this administration.  Within hours, the Colombian government agreed to all of President Trump’s demands, proving America is once again respected on the world stage.\nSo, to foreign nationals who are thinking about trying to illegally enter the United States, think again.  Under this president, you will be detained, and you will be deported.      Every day, Americans are safer because of the violent criminals that President Trump’s administration is removing from our communities.\nOn January 23rd, ICE New York arrested a Turkish national for entry without inspection who is a known or suspected terrorist.  On January 23rd, ICE San Francisco arrested a citizen of Mexico unlawfully present in the United States who has been convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child aged 14 years or younger.  ICE Saint Paul has arrested a citizen of Honduras who was convicted of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor.  ICE Buffalo arrested a citizen of Ecuador who has been convicted of rape. \nICE Boston arrested a citizen of the Dominican Republic who has a criminal conviction for second-degree murder.  This criminal was convicted of murder for beating his pregnant wife to death in front of her five-year-old son.      And ICE Saint Paul also arrested a citizen of Mexico who was convicted of possessing pornographic material of a minor on a work computer.\nThese are the heinous individuals that this administration is removing from American communities every single day.  And to the brave state and local law enforcement officers, CBP, and ICE agents who are helping in the facilitation of this deportation operation, President Trump has your back and he is grateful for your hard work.\nOn the economic front, President Trump took immediate action to lower costs for families who are suffering from four long years of the Biden administration’s destructive and inflationary policies.  President Trump ordered the heads of all executive departments and agencies to help deliver emergency price relief to the American people, untangle our economy from Biden’s regulatory constraints, and end the reckless war on American energy.\nPresident Trump also signed sweeping executive orders to end the weaponization of government and restore common sense to the federal bureaucracy.  He directed all federal agencies to terminate illegal diversity, equity, and inclusion programs to help return America to a merit-based society.\nPresident Trump also signed an executive order declaring it is now the policy of the federal government that there are only two sexes: male and female.  Sanity has been restored.\nBefore I take your questions, I would like to point out to — all of you once again have access to the most transparent and accessible president in American history.  There has never been a president who communicates with the American people and the American press corps as openly and authentically as the 45th and now 47th president of the United States. \nThis past week, President Trump has held multiple news conferences, gaggled on Air Force One multiple times, and sat down for a two-part interview on Fox News, which aired last week.  As Politico summed it up best, “Trump is everywhere again,” and that’s because President Trump has a great story to tell about the legendary American revival that is well underway.\nAnd in keeping with this revolutionary media approach that President Trump deployed during the campaign, the Trump White House will speak to all media outlets and personalities, not just the legacy media who are seated in this room, because apporting — according to recent polling from Gallup, Americans’ trust in mass media has fallen to a record low.  Millions of Americans, especially young people, have turned from traditional television outlets and newspapers to consume their news from podcasts, blogs, social media, and other independent outlets.\nIt’s essential to our team that we share President Trump’s message everywhere and adapt this White House to the new media landscape in 2025.  To do this, I am excited to announce the following changes will be made to this historic James S. Brady Briefing Room, where Mr. Brady’s legacy will endure.\nThis White House believes strongly in the First Amendment, so it’s why our team will work diligently to restore the press passes of the 440 journalists whose passes were wrongly revoked by the previous administration. \nWe’re also opening up this briefing room to new media voices who produce news-related content and whose outlet is not already represented by one of the seats in this room.  We welcome independent journalists, podcasters, social media influencers, and content creators to apply for credentials to cover this White House.  And you can apply now on our new website, WhiteHouse.gov/NewMedia. \nStarting today, this seat in the front of the room, which is usually occupied by the press secretary staff, will be called the “new media” seat.  My team will review the applications and give credentials to new media applicants who meet our criteria and pass United States Secret Service requirements to enter the White House complex.\nSo, in light of these announcements, our first questions for today’s briefing will go to these new media members whose outlets, despite being some of the most viewed news websites in the country, have not been given seats in this room. \nAnd before I turn to questions, I do have news directly from the president of the United States that was just shared with me in the Oval Office from President Trump directly — an update on the New Jersey drones: After research and study, the drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons. \nMany of these drones were also hobbyists — recreational and private individuals that enjoy flying drones.  In meanti- — in the — in time, it got worse, due to curiosity.  This was not the enemy.  A — a statement from the president of the United States to start this briefing with some news.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to questions, and we will begin with our new media members: Mike Allen from Axios, Matt Boyle from Breitbart.      Mike, why don’t you go ahead.\nQ    Thank you very much.  Karoline, does the president see anything fishy about DeepSeek, either its origins or its cost?  And could China’s ability to make these models quicker, cheaper affect our thinking about expanding generation data centers, chip manufacturing?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Sure.  The president was asked about DeepSeek last night on Air Force One when he gaggled for, I think, the third or fourth time throughout the weekend with members of the traveling press corps.  The president said that he believes that this is a wake-up call to the American AI industry.  The last administration sat on their hands and allowed China to rapidly develop this AI program.\nAnd so, President Trump believes in restoring American AI dominance, and that’s why he took very strong executive action this past week to sign executive orders to roll back some of the onerous regulations on the AI industry.  And President Trump has also proudly appointed the first AI and crypto czar at this White House, David Sacks, whom I spoke with yesterday — very knowledgeable on this subject.  And his team is here working every single day to ensure American AI dominance.\nAs for the national security implications, I spoke with NSC this morning.  They are looking into what those may be, and when I have an update, I will share it with you, Mike.\nQ    And, Karoline, you say “restore” U.S. dominance.  Is there fear that the U.S. either is falling or has fallen behind?  And how would the president make sure the U.S. stays ahead?\nMS. LEAVITT:  No.  The president is confident that we will restore American dominance in AI. \nMatt.\nQ    Yeah.  So, Karoline, first off, thank you to you and President Trump for actually giving voices to new media outlets that represent millions and millions of Americans.  The thing I would add — the — I’ve got a two-part question for you.  The first is just: Can you expand upon what steps the White House is going to take to bring more voices, not less — which is what our founder, Andrew Breitbart, believed in — into this room, where they rightly belong?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah, absolutely.  And as I said in my opening statement, Matt, it is a priority of this White House to honor the First Amendment.  And it is a fact that Americans are consuming their news media from various different platforms, especially young people.  And as the youngest press secretary in history, thanks to President Trump, I take great pride in opening up this room to new media voices to share the president’s message with as many Americans as possible.\nIn doing so, number one, we will ensure that outlets like yours — Axios and Breitbart, which are widely respected and viewed outlets — have an actual seat in this room every day.  We also, again, encourage anybody in this country — whether you are a TikTok content creator, a blogger, a podcaster — if you are producing legitimate news content, no matter the medium, you will be allowed to apply for press credentials to this White House. \nAnd as I said earlier, our new media website is WhiteHouse.gov/NewMedia, and so we encourage people to apply.  Again, as long as you are creating news-related content of the day and you’re a legitimate independent journalist, you’re welcome to cover this White House. \nQ    And secondly, Karoline, you sa- — you laid out several of the actions that President Trump has taken.  Obviously, it’s a stark contrast to the previous administration and a breakneck speed from President Trump.  Can we expect that pace to continue as the hun- — the — you know, the first 100 days moves along here and beyond that?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Absolutely.  There is no doubt President Trump has always been the hardest working man in politics.  I think that’s been proven over the past week.  This president has, again, signed more than 300 executive orders.  He’s taken historic action. \nI gaggled aboard Air Force One to mark the first 100 days of this administration — 4:00 p.m. last Friday — first 100 hours, rather.  And this president did more in the first 100 hours than the previous president did in the first 100 days. \nSo, President Trump, I think you can all expect to — for him to continue to work at this breakneck speed.  So, I hope you’re all ready to work very hard.  I know that we are.\nZeke Miller.\nQ    Thanks, Karoline.  A question that we’ve asked your predecessors of both parties in this job.  When you’re up here in this briefing room speaking to the American public, do you view yourself and your role as speaking on — advocating on behalf of the president, or providing the unvarnished truth that is, you know, not to lie, not to obfuscate to the American people?\nMS. LEAVITT:  I commit to telling the truth from this podium every single day.  I commit to speaking on behalf of the president of the United States.  That is my job. \nAnd I will say it’s very easy to speak truth from this podium when you have a president who is implementing policies that are wildly popular with the American people, and that’s exactly what this administration is doing.  It’s correcting the lies and the wrongs of the past four years, many of the lies that have been told to your faces in this very briefing room.  I will not do that.\nBut since you brought up truth, Zeke, I would like to point out, while I vow to provide the truth from this podium, we ask that all of you in this room hold yourselves to that same standard.  We know for a fact there have been lies that have been pushed by many legacy media outlets in this country about this president, about his family, and we will not accept that.  We will call you out when we feel that your reporting is wrong or there is misinformation about this White House. \nSo, yes, I will hold myself to the truth, and I expect everyone in this room to do the same. \nQ    And, Karoline, just on a substantive question.  Yesterday, the White House Office of Management and Budget directed an across-the-board freeze with — with some exceptions for individual assistance.  We understand just federal grants.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Right.\nQ    It’s caused a lot of confusion around the country among Head Start providers, among providers — from services to homeless veterans, provid- — you know, Medicaid providers, states saying they’re having trouble accessing the portal.  Could you put — help us clear up some confusion —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yes.\nQ    — give some certainty to folks?  And then also, is that uncertainty — how does that uncertainty service the president’s voters?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Well, I think there’s only uncertainty in this room amongst the media.  There’s no uncertainty in this building. \nSo, let me provide the certainty and the clarity that all of you need.  This is not a blanket pause on federal assistance in grant programs from the Trump administration.  Individual assistance, that includes — I’m not naming everything that’s included, but just to give you a few examples — Social Security benefits, Medicare benefits, food stamps, welfare benefits — assistance that is going directly to individuals will not be impacted by this pause. \nAnd I want to make that very clear to any Americans who are watching at home who may be a little bit confused about some of the media reporting: This administration — if you are receiving individual assistance from the federal government, you will still continue to receive that. \nHowever, it is the responsibility of this president and this administration to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.  That is something that President Trump campaigned on.  That’s why he has launched DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, who is working alongside OMB.  And that’s why OMB sent out this memo last night, because the president signed an executive order directing OMB to do just this.  And the reason for this is to ensure that every penny that is going out the door is not conflicting with the executive orders and actions that this president has taken. \nSo, what does this pause mean?  It means no more funding for illegal DEI programs.  It means no more funding for the Green New Scam that has ta- — cost American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.  It means no more funding for transgenderism and wokeness across our federal bureaucracy and agencies.  No more funding for Green New Deal social engineering policies.  Again, people who are receiving individual asintan- — assistance, you will continue to receive that.\nAnd President Trump is looking out for you by issuing this pause because he is being good steward of your taxpayer dollars.\nQ    Thanks, Karoline. \nMS. LEAVITT:  Sure.\nQ    How long is this pause going to last?  And how is the Trump administration recommending that organizations that rely on federal funding make payroll, pay their rent in the meantime?\nMS. LEAVITT:  It is a temporary pause, and the Office of Management and Budget is reviewing the federal funding that has been going out the door, again, not for individual assistance, but for all of these other programs that I mentioned.\nI also spoke with the incoming director of OMB this morning, and he told me to tell all of you that the line to his office is open for other federal government agencies across the board, and if they feel that programs are necessary and in line with the president’s agenda, then the Office of Management and Budget will review those policies. \nI think this is a very responsible measure.  Again, the past four years, we’ve seen the Biden administration spend money like drunken sailors.  It’s a big reason we’ve had an inflation crisis in this country, and it’s incumbent upon this administration to make sure, again, that every penny is being accounted for honestly.\nQ    Why impose this pause with so little notice?  Why not give organizations more time to plan for the fact that they are about to lose, in some cases, really crucial federal funding —\nMS. LEAVITT:  There was —\nQ    — at least for a — for a period of time?\nMS. LEAVITT:  There was notice.  It was the executive order that the president signed. \nThere’s also a freeze on hiring, as you know; a regulatory freeze; and there’s also a freeze on foreign aid.  And this is a — again, incredibly important to ensure that this administration is taking into consideration how hard the American people are working.  And their tax dollars actually matter to this administration. \nYou know, just during this pause, DOGE and OMB have actually found that there was $37 million that was about to go out the door to the World Health Organization, which is an organization, as you all know, that President Trump, with the swipe of his pen in that executive order, is — no longer wants the United States to be a part of.  So, that wouldn’t be in line with the president’s agenda. \nDOGE and OMB also found that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.  That is a preposterous waste of taxpayer money. \nSo, that’s what this pause is focused on: being good stewards of tax dollars. \nQ    And so, this doesn’t affect —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Jennifer.\nQ    — Meals on Wheels or Head Start or disaster aid?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Again, it does not affect individual assistance that’s going to Americans.\nQ    To follow up on Nancy, do you think there will be a list of who is affected and how much money is affected?  How — how will these contractors and organizations know if they are actually being — having their funding frozen?\nAnd then, secondly, if you’re willing, can you just clarify, is the end goal of this to essentially challenge Congress or to — to prove that the president can withhold federal funding?  Is — in other words, is this an attempt to pick a fight to prove that he can do this?\nMS. LEAVITT:  No, absolutely not.  As it says right here in the memo, which I have — and I’d encourage all of you to read it — it says, “The American people elected President Trump to be the president of the United States and gave him a mandate to increase the impact of every federal dollar.”  “This memo requires federal agencies to identify and review all Federal financial assistance programs and supporting activities consistent with the president’s policies and requirements.” \nThe American people gave President Trump an overwhelming mandate on November 5th, and he’s just trying to ensure that the tax money going out the door in this very bankrupt city actually aligns with the will and the priorities of the American people. \n(Cross-talk.)\nBrian Glenn.\nQ    Yes.  Welcome. \nMS. LEAVITT:  Thank you.\nQ    You look great.  You’re doing a great job. \nMS. LEAVITT:  Thank you.\nQ    You talked about transparency.  And some of us in this room know how just transparent President Trump has been the last five or six years; I think you’ll do the same. \nMy question is, do you think this latest incident with the president of Colombia is indicative of the global, powerful respect they have for President Trump moving forward not only to engage in — in economic diplomacy with these countries but also world peace?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Absolutely.  I’ll echo the answer that the president gave on Air Force One last night when he was asked a very similar question by one of your colleagues in the media: This signifies peace through strength is back, and this president will not tolerate illegal immigration into America’s interior. \nAnd he expects every nation on this planet, again, to cooperate with the repatriation of their citizens who illegally entered into our country and broke America’s laws.  Won’t be tolerated. \nAnd as you saw, the Colombian government quickly folded and agreed to all of President Trump’s demands.  Flights are underway once again.\n(Cross-talk.)\nDiana.\nQ    Two questions on deportations, if I may.  President Trump had said on the campaign trail that he would deport pro-Hamas students who are here on visas, and on his first day in office, he signed an executive order that said, quote, “The U.S. must ensure that admitted aliens and aliens otherwise already present in the U.S. do not bear hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles.”  So, should we take this executive order as Trump saying he would be open to de- — deporting those students who are here on visas, but, you know, hold pro-Hamas sympathies?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The president is open to deporting individuals who have broken our nation’s immigrations laws.  So, if they are here illegally, then certainly he is open to deporting them, and that’s what this administration is hard at work at doing. \nWe receive data from DHS and from ICE every single day.  From what we hear on the ground, ICE agents are feeling incredibly empowered right now because they actually have a leader in this building who is supporting them in doing their jobs that they were hired to do, which is to detain, arrest, and deport illegal criminals who have invaded our nation’s borders over the past four years.  That’s what the president is committed to seeing. \nQ    One more. \nMS. LEAVITT:  Peter.         Q    Just following up on that, Karoline —\nQ    Karoline, if I could ask you very quickly, just following up on the question on immigration.  First, President Trump, during the course of the campaign in 2024, said the following about illegal im- — immigration.  He said, “They’re going back home where they belong, and we start with the criminals.  There are many, many criminals.”  NBC News has learned that ICE arrested 1,179 undocumented immigrants on Sunday, but nearly half of them — 566 of the migrants — appear to have no prior criminal record besides entering the country illegally. \nMS. LEAVITT:  (Laughs.)\nQ    Is the president still focused exclusiv- — which is a civil crime, not a — not a — it’s not criminal —\nMS. LEAVITT:  It’s a federal crime. \nQ    It’s a fed- — so, I’m asking though, he said he was going to focus on those violent offenders first.  So, is violent offenders no longer the predicate for these people to be deported?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The president has said countless times on the campaign trail — I’ve been with him at the rallies; I know you’ve been there covering them too, Peter — that he is focused on launching the largest mass deportation operation in American history of illegal criminals. \nAnd if you are an individual, a foreign national, who illegally enters the United States of America, you are, by definition, a criminal.  And so, therefore —\nQ    So, to be clear, it’s not exclusively —\nMS. LEAVITT:  — you are subject deportation. \nQ    I apologize for interrupting.  So, to be clear, it’s not — violent criminals do not receive precedence in terms of the deportations taking place?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The president has also said — two things can be true at the same time.  We want to deport illegal criminals, illegal immigrants from this country.  But the president has said that, of course, the illegal dr- — criminal drug dealers, the rapists, the murderers, the individuals who have committed heinous acts on the interior of our country and who have terrorized law-abiding American citizens, absolutely, those should be the priority of ICE.  But that doesn’t mean that the other illegal criminals who entered our nation’s borders are off the table. \nQ    Understood.  Then let me ask you a separate question about the confusion that still exists across the country right now as it relates to the — the freeze — or the pause, as it’s described.  President Trump, of course, ran — one of the key policy items was that he was going to lower prices, lower the cost of everything from groceries, as he often said.  But in many of the cases, it would seem that some of these moves could raise prices for real Americans on everything from low-income heating — that program; childcare programs.  Will nothing that the president is doing here, in terms of the freeze in these programs, raise prices on ordinary Americans?\nMS. LEAVITT:  What particular actions are you referring to that would —\nQ    I’m referring to LHEAP right now.  That’s the low-income heating program, for example.  We can talk about — there’s no clarity, so I could refer to a lot of them.  We don’t know what they are specifically.  Can you tell us that LHEAP — that LIHEAP is not one of those affected?\nMS. LEAVITT:  So, you’re asking a hypoc- — -thetical based on programs that you can’t even identify?\nQ    No, I just identified — I —\nMS. LEAVITT:  What I can tell you is that the —\nQ    Well, just to be — just to be clear, since you guys haven’t identified, let’s do it together, just for Americans at home.  Medicaid, is that affected?\nMS. LEAVITT:  I gave you a list of examples — Social Security, Medicare, welfare benefits —\nQ    Medicaid too, correct?\nMS. LEAVITT:  — food stamps — that will not be impacted by this federal pause.  I can get you the full list after this briefing from the Office of Management and Budget.\nBut I do want to address the cost cutting, because that’s certainly very important, and — and cutting the cost of living in this country.  President Trump has taken historic action over the past week to do that.  He actually signed a memorandum to deliver emergency price relief for American families, which took a number of actions.  I can walk you through those. \nHe also repealed many onerous Biden administration regulations.  We know, over the past four years, American households has been essentially taxed $55,000 in regulations from the previous administration.  President Trump, with the swipe of his pen, rescinded those, which will ultimately put more money back in the pockets of the American people.  So, deregulation is a big deal. \nAnd then, when it comes to energy, I mean, the president signed an executive order to declare a national energy emergency here at home, which is going to make America energy dominant.  We know that energy is one of the number-one drivers of inflation, and so that’s why the president wants to increase our energy supply: to bring down costs for Americans.  The Trump energy boom is incoming, and Americans can expect that.\nQ    Please share that memo.  Thank you.\nMS. LEAVITT:  I will.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Karoline, I think — some of the confusion, I think, may be here with this pause on federal funding.  You’ve made it clear you’re not stopping funds that go directly to individuals, but there certainly are lots of organizations that receive funding and then may pass along a benefit — Meals on Wheels, for one.  They provide meals for over 2.2 million seniors. \nWhat is the president’s message to Americans out there, many of whom supported him and voted for him, who are concerned that this is going to impact them directly, even if, as you said, the funding isn’t coming directly to their wallet?\nMS. LEAVITT:  I have now been asked and answered this question four times.  To individuals at home who receive direct assistance from the federal government, you will not be impacted by this federal freeze.  In fact, OMB just sent out a memo to Capitol Hill with Q and A to — to clarify some of the questions and the answers that all of you are a- — are asking me right now. \nAgain, direct assistance will not be impacted.  I’ve been asked and answered about this OMB memo.  There’s many other topics of the day. \nJacqui Heinrich. \nQ    But on indirect assistance, Karoline —\nQ    Thank you, Karoline.\nQ    — if it’s going to another organization and then trickling down?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Direct assistance that is in the hands of the American people will not be impacted. \nAgain, as I said to Peter, we will continue to provide that list as it comes to fruition.  But OMB right now is focused on analyzing the federal government’s spending, which is exactly what the American people elected President Trump to do. \n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Thank you, Karoline.\nQ    And one question on immigration, Karoline.  On immigration. \nQ    Thank you, Karo- —\nQ    Of the 3,500 arrests ICE has made so far since President Trump came back into office, can you just tell us the numbers?  How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the country illegally.\nMS. LEAVITT:  All of them, because they illegally broke our nation’s laws, and, therefore, they are criminals, as far as this administration goes.  I know the last administration didn’t see it that way, so it’s a big culture shift in our nation to view someone who breaks our immigration laws as a criminal.  But that’s exactly what they are. \nJacqui.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Karoline, on tariffs.\nQ    But you made a point of going with the worst first. \nQ    On tariffs.\nQ    They all have a criminal record?\nQ    And welcome to the briefing room.\nMS. LEAVITT:  If they broke our nation’s laws, yes, they are a criminal. \nYes.\nQ    Thank you.  On stripping security details for figures like John Bolton, Pompeo, Brian Hook.  Senator Tom Cotton said that he’s seen the intelligence and the threat from Iran is real for anyone who played a role in the Soleimani strike.  He voiced concern it wouldn’t just impact those individuals but potentially their family, innocent bystanders, friends — anyone who is near them when they’re out in public.  Is the president open to reconsidering his decision?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The president was asked and answered this yesterday, and he was firm in his decision, despite some of the comments that you had referenced.  And he’s made it very clear that he does not believe American taxpayers should fund security details for individuals who have served in the government for the rest of their lives.  And there’s nothing stopping these individuals that you mentioned from obtaining private security. \nThat’s where the president stands on it.  I have no updates on that. \nQ    Is there any concern that this decision might jeopardize the administration’s ability to hire the best advisers for these kinds of positions in the future?\nMS. LEAVITT:  No.  In fact, I’ve talked to the Presidential Personnel Office who has told me directly that there is such an influx of resumes for this administration that it’s incredibly overwhelming.  There is no lack of talent for the Trump administration. \nReagan Ree- —\nQ    And would he — would he take any responsibility —\nQ    Thanks, Karoline.\nQ    — if anything happened to these people?  Would he feel at all that his decision was a factor in that?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The president was asked and answered this yesterday.  I’d defer you to his comments.\nQ    Thanks, Karoline.\nQ    Karoline —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Reagan, since you’re in the back row, I hear y- — the back row hasn’t gotten much attention in the last four years —\nQ    Yes, thank you.\nMS. LEAVITT:  — so I’m happy to answer your question. \nQ    And I can project.  (Laughter.)\nDoes the president intend to permanently cut off funding to NGOs that are bringing illegal foreign nationals to the country, such as Catholic Charities?\n     MS. LEAVITT:  I am actually quite certain that the president signed an executive order that did just that, and I can point you to that.\n     Q    One more, Karoline.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah.\nQ    President Trump issued an executive order on increased vetting for refugees in visa applications. \nMS. LEAVITT:  That’s right.\nQ    Part of that order was considering an outright ban for countries that have deficient screening processes.  Has the president considered yet which countries might fall into this category?  Are countries like Afghanistan or Syria under consideration for a full ban?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah.  So, the president signed an executive order to streamline the vetting for visa applicants and for illegal immigrants in this country who are coming, of course, from other nations. \nIt also directed the secretary of State to review the process and make sure that other countries around the world are being completely transparent with our nation and the individuals that they are sending here.  And so, the secretary of State has been directed to report back to the president.  I haven’t seen that report yet.  We’ve only been here for a few days.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Karoline, two questions for you.  One on the freeze in federal funding.  Who advised the president on the legality of telling government agencies that they don’t have to spend money that was already appropriated by Congress?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Well, as the OMB memo states, this is certainly within the confines of the law. \nSo, White House Counsel’s Office believes that this is within the pe- — president’s power to do it, and therefore, he’s doing it.\nQ    Okay.  So, they disagree with lawmakers who say that they don’t have the power to — to freeze this funding?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Again, I would point you to the language in the memo that clearly states this is within the law.\nQ    And on what happened on Friday night.  The — the administration fired several inspectors general without giving Congress the 30-day legally required notification that they were being fired.  I think only two were left at DO- — DHS and the DOJ.  And then, yesterday, we saw several prosecutors — I believe 12 — fired from the Justice Department who worked on the investigations into the president.  As you know, they are career prosecutors; therefore, they are afforded civil service protections.  How is the administration deciding which laws to follow and which ones to ignore?\nMS. LEAVITT:  So, it is the belief of this White House and the White House Counsel’s Office that the president was within his exe- — executive authority to do that.  He is the executive of the executive branch, and, therefore, he has the power to fire anyone within the executive branch that he wishes to. \nThere’s also a case that went before the Supreme Court in 2020: Scaila [Seila] Law LLC, v. the Customs — the [Consumer Financial Protection] Bureau Protection.  I would advise you to look at that case, and that’s the legality that this White House has rested on. \nQ    So, you’re confident that if they bring lawsuits against you — those prosecutors who were fired — that — that they will succeed?\nMS. LEAVITT:  We will win in court, yes.\nQ    And did he personally direct this, given they worked on the classified documents investigation and the election interference investigation?\nMS. LEAVITT:  This was a memo that went out by the Presidential Personnel Office, and the president is the leader of this White House.  So, yes.\nQ    So, it did come from him?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yes, it came from this White House.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Karoline.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Sir.\nQ    Thank you.  Congrats on your first day behind the podium.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Thank you.\nQ    President Trump ended funding for UNRWA and also designated the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization.\nMS. LEAVITT:  That’s right.\nQ    Both were decisions that the previous administration had reversed.  So, here’s my question: Will there be an investigation into who gave the previous administration this terrible advice?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Well, that’s a very good point.  I haven’t heard discussions about such an ins- — investigation, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea, considering that the Houthis cer- — certainly are terrorists.  They have launched attacks on U.S. naval ships across this world, and so I think it was a very wise move by this administration to redesignate them as a terrorist group, because they are.  And I think it was a foolish decision by the previous administration to do so. \nAs for an investigation, I’m not sure about that, but it’s not a bad idea.\n(Cross-talk.)\nJosh.\nQ    Thank you for the question.  I appreciate it.  Can you give us an update on the president’s plan for his tariff agenda?  He spoke a lot about this yesterday, and there’s a couple of dates coming up that —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Sure.\nQ    — he’s spoken to.  Number one, February 1st.  He’s alluded to both the potential for tariffs for Canada and Mexico but also China to take effect on those days.  Where is — what’s he thinking about that?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah.\nQ    Should those countries expect that on the 1st?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Again, he was asked and answered this question this past weekend when he took a lot of questions from the press, and he said that the February 1st date for Canada and Mexico still holds.\nQ    And what about the China 10 percent tariff that he also had mused about last Tuesday going into effect on the same date?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah, the president has said that he is very much still considering that for February 1st.\nQ    And then, separately, yesterday, he talked also about sectoral tariffs on, for instance, pharmaceuticals, as well as semiconductor computer chips.  He talked about steel, aluminum, and copper.  What’s the timeline on those?  Is that a similar sort of “coming days” thing or —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah, so when the president talked about that in his speech yesterday, that actually wasn’t a new announcement.  That was within a presidential memorandum that he signed in one of the first days here in the White House on his America First trade agenda.  So, there’s more details on those tariffs in there.\nAs far as a date, I don’t have a specific date to read out to you, but the president is committed to implementing tariffs effectively, just like he did in his first term.\nQ    And then — and then, finally, he also was asked on the plane when he gaggled about the potential for a universal tariff.  He was asked maybe about two and a half percent.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah.\nQ    There was a report about that.  He said he wanted “much bigger than that.”  Should we understand that these tariffs would add up?  You know, in other words, you might have country-specific tariffs like Canada, Mexico, China.  You might have sectoral tariffs, like on pharmaceuticals, as well as a potential universal tariff on top of that.  Do these stack on one or the other, or would one sort of take precedence over another?\nMS. LEAVITT:  All I can point you to is what the president has said on this front: the February 1st date for Canada and Mexico and also the China tariff that he has discussed.\nHe rejected the 2.5 percent tariff.  He said that was a little bit too low.  He wants it to be higher. \nI’ll leave it to him to make any decisions on that front.\nQ    Do you have any comment on what the —\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    — what the Mexicans and Canadians —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Phil.\nQ    — have done so far?  Do you have any comment on whether that has met the bar of what he wants to see on fentanyl?  Thank you.\nMS. LEAVITT:   I — I won’t get ahead of the president, again, on advocating to foreign nations on what they should or shouldn’t do to get away from these tariffs.  The president has made it very clear, again, that he expects every nation around this world to cooperate with the repatriation of their citizens.  And the president has also put out specific statements in terms of Canada and Mexico when it comes to what he expects in terms of border security.\nWe have seen a historic level of cooperation from Mexico.  But, again, as far as I’m still tracking — and that was last night talking to the president directly — February 1st is still on the books.\nQ    Thank you.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Phil.\nQ    Thank you, Karoline.  Quick programming note, and then a question on taxes.\nMS. LEAVITT:  A programming note.\nQ    Well, in terms of programming, should —\nMS. LEAVITT:  That sounds fun. \nQ    — we expect to see you here every day?  How frequently will these —\nQ    That’s a good question.\nQ    — press briefings be?\nMS. LEAVITT:  It is a good question, April.\nSo, look, the president, as you know, is incredibly accessible.  First day here, he wanted all of you in the Oval Office.  You got a 60-minute press conference with the leader of the free world — while he was simultaneously signing executive orders, I may add.  That’s pretty impressive.  I don’t think the previous office holder would be able to pull such a thing off. \nSo, look, the president is the best spokesperson that this White House has, and I can assure you that you will be hearing from both him and me as much as possible.\nQ    And then a question about tax cuts.  You know, the president has promised to extend the tax cuts from the previous term.  I’m curious, you know, does the president support corresponding spending cuts, as some Republicans have called for in Congress?  And will the new Treasury secretary be leading those negotiations with the Hill, as Mnuchin did during the first administration?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The president is committed to both tax cuts and spending cuts.\nAnd he has a great team negotiating on his behalf, but there’s no better negotiator than Donald Trump, and I’m sure he’ll be involved in this reconciliation process as it moves forward.\n(Cross-talk.)\nQ    Karoline, in the announcement that you made last night on the Iron Dome, it said the president had directed that the United States will build this Iron Dome.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah.\nQ    When you read into the executive order, it seemed short of that.  It asked for a series of studies —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yeah.\nQ    — and reports back on — can you tell us whether the president has directed this and, if he is this concerned on this issue, why the suspensions that we saw listed by OMB included so many different nuclear programs, nonproliferation programs, programs to blend down nuclear weapons, and s- — and so forth?\nMS. LEAVITT:  First of all, when it comes to the Iron Dome, the executive order directed the implementation of the — of an Iron Dome.  It also, as you said, kind of directed research and studies to see if — or — or how the United States can go about doing this, particularly the Department of Defense.\nWhen it comes to the other question that you asked about those specific programs, again, I would say, this is not a — a ban; this is a temporary pause and a freeze to ensure that all of the money going out from Washington, D.C., is in align with the president’s agenda.\nAnd as the Office of Management and Budget has updates on what will be kick-started, once again, I will provide those to you. \nQ    Can you clarify for a sec what you were saying before on Medicaid?  It wasn’t clear to me whether you were saying that no Medicaid would be cut off.  Obviously, a lot of this goes to states before it goes to individuals and so forth.  So, are you guaranteeing here that no individual now on Medicaid would see a cutoff because of the pause?\nMS. LEAVITT:  I’ll check back on that and get back to you. \nJon.\nQ    Thanks a lot, Karoline.  As you know, in the first week that the president was in office, signed an executive order as it relates to birthright citizenship — trying to eliminate that.  Now, 22 state attorney generals have said that this is unconstitutional.  A federal judge has just agreed with their argument.  What’s the administration’s argument for doing away with birthright citizenship?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The folks that you mentioned have a right to have that legal opinion, but it is in disagreement with the legal opinion of this administration. \nThis administration believes that birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, and that is why President Trump signed that executive order.  Illegal immigrants who come to this country and have a child are not subject to the laws of this jurisdiction.  That’s the opinion of this administration. \nWe have already appealed the rul- — the lawsuit that was filed against this administration, and we are prepared to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to, because President Trump believes that this is a necessary step to secure our nation’s borders and protect our homeland. \nMonica.\nQ    And then on foreign policy — on foreign policy, Karoline —\nQ    Thank you, Karoline.  It’s great to see you, and you’re doing a great —\nQ    — on foreign policy, if I may.  The president’s commitment to the NATO defense Alliance, is it as strong as the prior administration?  Is it the same as when he served as president in his first term in office?\nMS. LEAVITT:  As long as NATO pays their fair share.\nAnd President Trump has called on NATO Allies to increase their defense spending to 5 percent.  You actually saw the head of NATO at Davos last week on Bloomberg Television saying that President Trump is right and if Europe wants to keep itself safe, they should increase their defense spending. \nI would just add that there was no greater ally to our European allies than President Trump in his first term.  The world, for all nations in Europe, and, of course, here at home was much safer because of Presidents Tru- — Trump’s peace through strength diplomatic approach. \nMonica.\nQ    Karoline —\nQ    Thank you.  Thank you, Karoline.  And it’s great to finally be called on as well in the briefing room.  I appreciate that. \nMS. LEAVITT:  You’re welcome. \nQ    Of course, we know President Trump just got back from North Carolina and California meeting with victims of natural disasters.  There’s the two-year anniversary of the East Palestine, Ohio, toxic train derailment.  Does the president have any plans to go visit the victims of that toxic spill or just visit in general?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Not — no plans that I can read out for you here.  If that changes, I will certainly keep you posted. \nWhat I can tell you is that President Trump still talks about his visit to East Palestine, Ohio.  That was one of the turning points, I would say, in the previous election campaign, where Americans were reminded that President Trump is a man of the people.  And he, as a candidate, visited that town that was just derailed by the train derailment — no pun intended — and he offered support and hope, just like I saw the president do this past week. \nIt was a purposeful decision by this president, on his first domestic trip, to go to North Carolina and to California to visit with Americans who were impacted by Hurricane Helene and also by the deadly fires — a red state and a blue state, both of which feel forgotten by the previous administration and the federal government.  That has now — that has now ended under President Trump. \nHe will continue to put Americans first, whether they’re in East Palestine, in Pacific Palisades, or in North Carolina.\n(Cross-talk.)\nSure.\nQ    Thank you, Karoline.  On California, could you please clarify what the military did with the water last night, as referenced in the president’s Truth Social post?\nMS. LEAVITT:  The water has been turned back on in California, and this comes just days after President Trump visited Pacific Palisades and, as you all saw, applied tremendous pressure on state and local officials in Pacific Palisades, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, to turn on the water and to direct that water to places in the south and in the middle of the state that have been incredibly dry, which has led to the expansion — the rapid expansion of these fires.\nQ    So, could you clarify what the military’s role was, where the water came from, and how it got there?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Again, the Army Corps of Engineers has been on the ground in California to respond to the devastation from these wildfires.  And I would point out that just days after President Trump visited the devastation from these fires, the water was turned on.  That is because of the pressure campaign he put on state and local officials there, who clearly lack all common sense. \nAnd I will never forget being at that round table with the president last week and hearing the frustration in the voices of Pacific Palisades residents who feel as though their government has just gone insane.  Before President Trump showed up on the scene, Karen Bass was telling private property owners that they would have to wait 18 months to access their private property.\nSo, this administration, the president and his team that’s on the ground in California — Ric Grenell, who he has designated to oversee this great crisis — ha- — will continue to put pressure on Karen Bass and state and local officials to allow residents to access their properties. \nThis is a huge part of it.  These residents want to take part in their own clearing out of their properties.  They should be able to do that.  It’s the United States of America.  What happened to our freedom?  Clearly, it’s gone in California, but not anymore under President Trump.\nQ    Karoline —\nMS. LEAVITT:  April.\nQ    Karoline, welcome to the briefing room.\nMS. LEAVITT:  Thank you.\nQ    Several questions.  One on the pause.  Will minority-serving institutions, preferably colleges and universities, have those monies held back temporarily at this moment?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Again, I have not seen the entire list, because this memo was just sent out.  So, I will provide you all with updates as we receive them.  Okay?\nQ    Karoline —\nQ    And secondly — als- —\nQ    Karoline.\nQ    Also, secondly, when it comes to immigration, there is this southern border focus.  What happens to those who have overstayed their visas?  That is part of the broken immigration system.  In 2023, there was a report by the Biden administration, the Homeland Security Department, that said overstays of visas were three times more than usual.  Will there be a focus on the overstays for visas as well?\nMS. LEAVITT:  If an individual is overstaying their visa, they are therefore an illegal immigrant residing in this country, and they are subject to deportation.  \nQ    And also, lastly —\nMS. LEAVITT:  Yes.\nQ    Lastly, as we’re dealing with anti-DEI, anti-woke efforts, we understand this administration could — is thinking about celebrating Black History Month.  Have you got any word on that?  Anything that you can offer to us?\nMS. LEAVITT:  As far as I know, this White House certainly still intends to celebrate, and we will continue to celebrate American history and the contributions that all Americans, regardless of race, religion, or creed, have made to our great country.  And America is back.\nChristian Datoc.\nQ    Thanks, Karoline.  Just real quick.  You mentioned the inflation executive order the president signed, but egg prices have skyrocketed since President Trump took office.  So, what specifically is he doing to lower those costs for Americans?\nMS. LEAVITT:  Really glad you brought this up, because there is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs.  I would like to point out to each and every one of you that, in 2024, when Joe Biden was in the Oval Office — or upstairs in the residence sleeping; I’m not so sure — egg prices increased 65 percent in this country.  We also have seen the cost of everything, not just eggs — bacon, groceries, gasoline — have increased because of the inflationary policies of the last administration.\nAs far as the egg shortage, what’s also contributing to that is that the Biden administration and the Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of more than 100 million chickens, which has led to a lack of chicken supply in this country, therefore a lack of egg supply, which is leading to the shortage.\nSo, I will leave you with this point.  This is an example of why it’s so incredibly important that the Senate moves swiftly to confirm all of President Trump’s nominees, including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, who is already speaking with Kevin Hassett, who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\nAs for cots, I laid out — costs — I laid out the plethora of ways that President Trump has addressed saving costs for the American people over the past week.  He looks forward to continuing to doing that —\nQ    Karoline, what —\nMS. LEAVITT:  — in the days ahead.\n(Cross-talk.)\nThank you, guys, so much.  I’ll see you soon.\nEND                1:52 P.M. EST",

Ann Wagner, R-MO-2, and 151 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly supports H.R. 21 the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and applauds the House for its efforts to protect the most vulnerable and prevent infanticide.\nCurrent law fails to provide adequate protections, including adequate requirements for the provision of medical care, for vulnerable newborns who survive an abortion attempt. If enacted, H.R. 21 would require any healthcare practitioner who is present at the time that such a child is born to exercise care to preserve the child’s life and health, and to ensure the child is immediately transported and admitted to a hospital. The bill would also require a healthcare practitioner, or hospital employee, to immediately report a violation of these requirements. H.R. 21 would establish a civil right of action for, and prevent criminal prosecution and penalties from being brought against, the mothers of such children.\nAs President Trump established through Executive Order 13952 of September 25, 2020, it is the policy of the United States to recognize the human dignity and inherent worth of every newborn or other infant child, regardless of prematurity or disability, and to ensure for each child due protection under the law.\nA baby that survives an abortion and is born alive into this world should be treated just like any other baby born alive. H.R. 21 would properly amend current law to ensure that the life of one baby is not treated as being more or less valuable than another.\nIf H.R. 21 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend he sign it into law.",

Vaeth, Acting Director, Office of Management and Budget  \nKevin Hassett, Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council\nSUBJECT: Guidance Regarding Section 7 of the Executive Order Unleashing American Energy\nThe directive in section 7 of the Executive Order entitled Unleashing American Energy requires agencies to immediately pause disbursement of funds appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58).  This pause only applies to funds supporting programs, projects, or activities that may be implicated by the policy established in Section 2 of the order. This interpretation is consistent with section 7’s heading (“Terminating the Green New Deal”) and its reference to the “law and the policy outlined in section 2 of th[e] order.”\nFor the purposes of implementing section 7 of the Order, funds supporting the “Green New Deal” refer to any appropriations for objectives that contravene the policies established in section 2.  Agency heads may disburse funds as they deem necessary after consulting with the Office of Management and Budget.",
